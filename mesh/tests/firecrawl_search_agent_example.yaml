            \n# 01\\. Introduction\n\nIn a digital age rife with data breaches and\
            \ online vulnerabilities, building trust is more crucial than ever. Zero\
            \ knowledge proofs (zk proofs) offer an elegant solution beyond traditional\
            \ privacy measures by allowing one party to verify certain information\
            \ without ever disclosing the information itself.\n\nExperts say zk proofs\
            \ have the potential to revolutionize various industries, from finance\
            \ and healthcare to luxury fashion and decentralized systems like blockchain,\
            \ ushering in a new era of security and assurance. Independent research\
            \ shows that zk proof generation will become a $\\\\mathfrak{s}\\\\i0$\
            \ billion market by the year 2030. Web3 services will require almost 90\
            \ billion zk proofs to be performed in 2030, with market-wide completion\
            \ of 83,000 transactions per second. This report will cover some familiar\
            \ zk proof territory, including the differences between zk-STARKs and\
            \ zkSNARKs, a timeline of innovations in this space, challenges and future\
            \ projections. The focus, however, is today’s exciting inflection point\
            \ where zk proofs are moving from research projects to serious business\
            \ – an analysis derived from new and firsthand accounts from leading companies\
            \ within the ecosystem of $^{250+}$ companies that form the Protocol Labs\
            \ innovation network. With a shared mission to shape the future of computing,\
            \ PL companies — including CryptoNet, Gensyn, Ingonyama, Lurk Lab, Polybase,\
            \ Rarimo, StarkWare, Zama — have contributed to the world of zk proofs\
            \ for years and will share their exclusive insights in this report.\n\n\
            Companies like Lurk Lab zero in on the complex mathematical models that\
            \ form the basis of zk proofs. They believe the zk proof space is poised\
            \ for growth:\n\n“There’s been a decade of work to improve zk protocols\
            \ that are leading to real business – we’re even seeing boutique venture\
            \ capital firms that exclusively invest in this space. We are at an inflection\
            \ point of better technology and more capital moving towards zk proofs,\"\
            \ said John Burnham, cofounder of Lurk Lab. \"It’s a Cambrian explosion.”\n\
            \nThis report features exclusive research and expert commentary on the\
            \ properties of zk proofs, use cases, challenges, potential disruptors,\
            \ signs of momentum and future outlook.\n\nIngonyama, a PL network team\
            \ that solves for hardware limitations by building semi-conductors to\
            \ accelerate zkSNARKs, stresses the importance of privacy in the next\
            \ iteration of the internet:\n\n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/51f435ef-380f-4993-bc3b-af6993a2d51d/images/56ff147a935b9d92a3fcdecfc44cadc9fa3fcaef306b761939add29d16821bea.jpg)\n\
            \nElan Neiger, head of marketing, Ingonyama\n\n“Information is the most\
            \ valuable currency in the world. Yet we are all guilty of oversharing\
            \ our data to third parties on the internet. Today if you want to prove\
            \ one aspect of yourself, such as age, you must upload an ID which contains\
            \ so much extra information —  full name, address, country of citizenship,\
            \ etc. What happens to that data? Often we find it's been leaked or stolen.\
            \ This scenario happens every day in the digital world. The problem of\
            \ oversharing can be solved by zk proofs, which are the most powerful\
            \ cryptography that exists today for hiding data, while allowing for assertions\
            \ on that data. ZK proofs are considered one of the greatest achievements\
            \ of cryptography in the last 50 years.”\n\n# 02\\. What are ZeroKnowledge\
            \ Proofs?\n\nPicture this:\n\nYou’re driving in an upscale neighborhood\
            \ and spot the perfect house. You dial the realtor’s number, ready to\
            \ hear the asking price. What if there was a way to prove to the realtor\
            \ right away that you’re good for the money — no matter the cost — without\
            \ revealing the total amount in your bank account? You could maintain\
            \ your financial privacy and put in an offer right away.\n\nHere enters\
            \ the concept of a zero knowledge proof (zk proof). In this scenario,\
            \ you present a zk proof to confirm you have enough funds for the down\
            \ payment without revealing your entire bank balance or personal wealth.\
            \ By establishing trust without unnecessary disclosures, zk proofs find\
            \ practical application in various daily scenarios — ensuring secure digital\
            \ transactions, verifying identity without exposing sensitive data, and\
            \ revolutionizing privacy in the digital age.\n\nIn 1985, Shafi Goldwasser,\
            \ Silvio Micali, and Charles Rackoff first introduced the concept of zk\
            \ proofs to the world. Years later, one of their mentees, Rosario Gennaro,\
            \ a researcher and former data scientist at Protocol Labs, wrote a highly\
            \ cited paper about more efficient, publicly verifiable computer schemes\
            \ that is still relied on today. He shares an example of a zk proof with\
            \ a technical explanation here:\n\n# Step by Step Example of a ZK Proof\n\
            \nstep 01.\n\nstep 02.\n\n# Setup\n\nEmily and David agree on the secret\
            \ vault's combination, but they want to ensure that Emily truly knows\
            \ it without exposing it.\n\n# Prover (Emily)\n\nEmily takes on the role\
            \ of the prover. She uses a zk proof technique to demonstrate her knowledge\
            \ of the combination without revealing what it is. Instead of showing\
            \ the combination directly, she performs a series of cryptographic operations\
            \ that prove she possesses the knowledge.\n\n# step 04.\n\nstep 03.\n\n\
            # Proof Generation\n\nEmily follows David's instructions using the knowledge\
            \ she has without revealing the combination itself. She provides the result\
            \ of her operations to David.\n\n# Verifier (David)\n\nDavid is the verifier\
            \ in this scenario. He wants to be convinced that Emily actually knows\
            \ the combination. David challenges Emily by asking her to prove her knowledge.\
            \ He provides specific instructions, such as asking her to perform operations\
            \ on the combination without revealing it.\n\n# step 05.\n\n# Verification\n\
            \nDavid checks Emily's response. If it's correct based on the instructions\
            \ he provided, he becomes convinced that Emily knows the combination without\
            \ actually learning the combination himself. If Emily didn't know the\
            \ combination, it would be highly improbable for her to consistently provide\
            \ correct responses based on David's instructions.\n\nIn this example,\
            \ the prover (Emily) demonstrates her knowledge of the combination to\
            \ the verifier (David) without revealing the actual combination. This\
            \ showcases the core concept of zk proofs, where one party can prove knowledge\
            \ of certain information without disclosing that information to the other\
            \ party, ensuring privacy and security in various applications like authentication\
            \ and cryptography.\n\n# 03\\. A Timeline of\n\n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/51f435ef-380f-4993-bc3b-af6993a2d51d/images/acb8be2b26dc11732719ca9b4109837ef99833c4570fcbafb9496dbbb7171ce2.jpg)\n\
            \n# 2019\n\nThe zk-SNARKs project releases Halo, a new zk-SNARKs system\
            \ that is more efficient and scalable than previous systems.\n\n# 2021\n\
            \nThe Ethereum Foundation announces the launch of the zkEVM project, which\
            \ aims to bring zk proofs to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n2021\n\nzkSync,\
            \ a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum using zk rollups, gains attention.\n\
            \n2021\n\nCairo, a programming language for zk-SNARKs, is introduced by\
            \ StarkWare, simplifying the development of zk-rollup solutions.\n\n#\
            \ 2020\n\nA Note on zk-SNARKS vs zk-STARKS\n\nFilecoin mainnet launches\
            \ as a decentralized storage network and cryptocurrency. Filecoin is currently\
            \ the largest deployed zk-SNARK to date. By 2023, the Filecoin network\
            \ produces 6-7 million zk-SNARK proofs daily, each proof encompassing\
            \ over 100 million arithmetic constraints.\n\n2022\n\nThe zkSync project\
            \ releases zkSync 2.0, a new zk rollup that is designed to be more efficient\
            \ and scalable than previous zk rollups.\n\nTwo cryptographic techniques,\
            \ created in tandem, fall under the umbrella of zk proofs: zk-SNARKs and\
            \ zk-STARKs. Both aim to achieve similar goals of proving the validity\
            \ of statements without revealing the underlying data, but they differ\
            \ in their underlying mechanisms and use cases~\n\nvzk-SNARK is a type\
            \ of zk proof that allows a prover to demonstrate the truth of a statement\
            \ to a verifier in a succinct and non-interactive manner. It's particularly\
            \ associated with privacy-preserving transactions in blockchain and cryptocurrency\
            \ systems, like Zcash.\x88 vzk-STARK is another type of zk proof that\
            \ also allows for proving the validity of statements without revealing\
            \ the underlying data. Though it requires interaction, it achieves better\
            \ security by removing the need for trusted setups, unlike zk-SNARKs.\n\
            \nFor details on zk-SNARKS vs zk-STARKS, read this piece by PL network\
            \ team Consensys.\n\n# 04\\. Current Major Use Cases\n\nZK proofs have\
            \ found diverse applications across various fields due to their unique\
            \ ability to verify information without revealing the underlying data.\
            \ Here are five major use cases:\n\n# Voting Systems\n\nIn a zk proof-based\
            \ voting system, voters can prove that their vote is valid without revealing\
            \ the actual choice they made. This maintains the secrecy of individual\
            \ votes, while ensuring that the total count is accurate. Similar to the\
            \ way they are used today by DAOs, zk proofs can be used to verify properties\
            \ of the election process, such as the absence of double voting or the\
            \ integrity of the tally, without revealing specific voter information.\n\
            \n# Cryptocurrencies\n\nZcash may be the most notable cryptocurrency dedicated\
            \ to preserving privacy – and zk proofs play a crucial role. They enable\
            \ confidential transactions where the sender, receiver, and transaction\
            \ amounts are hidden, while still ensuring the validity of transactions.\
            \ ZK proofs can also verify the correctness of smart contracts without\
            \ revealing the underlying data.\n\n# Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\n\
            Research shows that the DeFi market is growing rapidly and consistently,\
            \ nearly doubling each year since 2018. According to data, the market\
            \ is set to reach $\\\\mathbb{567.4}$ billion by 2026. This translates\
            \ to corresponding growth in the zk proof space, as DeFi platforms leverage\
            \ zk proofs to enhance privacy and scalability.\n\nZK proofs are used\
            \ to validate transactions and operations off-chain, while providing cryptographic\
            \ proof of their correctness on-chain. This reduces the computational\
            \ load on the blockchain and speeds up transaction processing. ZK proofs\
            \ can also be used in decentralized exchanges to prove that users possess\
            \ the necessary funds for trading without disclosing their exact balances.\n\
            \nSince 2019, when DeFi was relatively new, its quarter-on-quarter growth\
            \ has risen at a rapid rate, with over 6 million unique wallets completing\
            \ an onchain transaction each month since late-2022.\n\n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/51f435ef-380f-4993-bc3b-af6993a2d51d/images/7c559b632ab6131d332d3f8eea7f47f8277d096db11dd432fc77de4c79a1dfe6.jpg)\n\
            \nnumber of active defi users\n\n# Supply Chain Transparency and Traceability\n\
            \nZK proofs can be used to verify and authenticate the origin, movement,\
            \ and authenticity of products within a supply chain without revealing\
            \ sensitive proprietary information. This can enhance transparency by\
            \ allowing different entities to independently verify the accuracy of\
            \ claims made about products, such as their source, quality, and journey\
            \ through the supply chain. For example, zk proofs could be employed to\
            \ prove that a product was ethically sourced, without disclosing proprietary\
            \ supplier data.\n\n# Environmental Standards\n\nZK proofs can be applied\
            \ to verify compliance with environmental standards without revealing\
            \ sensitive business data. For instance, companies can demonstrate that\
            \ they meet certain emissions reduction targets without sharing specific\
            \ emission levels or proprietary information. This aids in maintaining\
            \ transparency and accountability while protecting sensitive information.\n\
            \n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/51f435ef-380f-4993-bc3b-af6993a2d51d/images/c2f311339e4d23e49af6697ef3a576f8b443b426322a4a681843186f3e956e57.jpg)\n\
            \nSid Gandhi, co-founder of Polybase Powered by zk proofs, Polybase is\
            \ a layer 2 blockchain with private transactions and MEV-resistance. A\
            \ member of the PL innovation network, Polybase’s co-founder Sid Gandhi\
            \ shares an example of an energy use case in the real world.\n\n“One of\
            \ the largest European energy companies wants to offer transparent data\
            \ around renewable energy generation. Rather than quarterly manual audits,\
            \ we look at real time data being generated from renewable resources.\
            \ What percentage of the energy generated and sent to this particular\
            \ client is green? Doing that in a cryptographically verifiable way isn't\
            \ really possible. Consider data centers that don't want to reveal second-by-second\
            \ energy data that they are consuming – that can be used for competitive\
            \ intelligence.\n\nWhat we allow with zk is the ability to keep that private\
            \ data private, but then prove some public attributes of that data. So\
            \ we could prove points like: what percentage of the data generated at\
            \ this particular time is renewable? That's a very motivating use case\
            \ for us, because that solves a real problem in the real world that we've\
            \ seen with real customers. It's really exciting for us to be able to\
            \ tackle this problem.”\n\n# 05\\. 4 Exciting Bets in ZK Proofs\n\nIn\
            \ the evolving landscape of zk proof technology, there are several projects\
            \ and cutting-edge techniques that are pushing the boundaries of what's\
            \ possible, with a primary focus on enhancing efficiency, scalability,\
            \ and usability. These innovative efforts are not only shaping the future\
            \ of zk proofs, but also working towards broader adoption across various\
            \ domains.\n\nAs these projects continue to mature and gain traction,\
            \ the potential for zk proofs to revolutionize industries beyond cryptocurrency\
            \ becomes increasingly evident, offering a promising future where privacy\
            \ and security are paramount in our digital interactions.\n\nResearch\
            \ shows that\n\n6 The zk proof market is projected to reach $\\\\mathbb{575}$\
            \ million in revenue in 2024,\n\n6 Has the potential to exceed $\\\\mathfrak{s}\\\
            \\mathord{\\\\uparrow}0$ billion in revenue by the year 2030,\n\n6 Web3\
            \ applications alone are expected to require almost 90 billion zk proofs\
            \ in 2030,\n\n6 The average market clearing price per proof is expected\
            \ to fall from $\\\\mathfrak{s o}.2\\\\uparrow$ in 2024 to $\\\\mathbb{50.12}$\
            \ by 2030\n\nTo that end, here are four big bets designed to increase\
            \ adoption, including three top projects and one important technique that\
            \ is helping build more efficient, scalable zk proof systems.\n\nSource:\
            \ Aligned.co , 2023\n\nA concept within the Ethereum ecosystem aimed at\
            \ developing a zk proof system that is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual\
            \ Machine (EVM). It involves various stakeholders, including developers,\
            \ researchers, and the Ethereum community. This would allow zk proofs\
            \ to be used for a wide variety of Ethereum applications.\n\n# 2zkSync\n\
            \nA method and project focused on developing zk rollups, a type of layer\
            \ 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. ZK rollups use zk proofs to bundle\
            \ multiple transactions together, verify them off-chain, and then submit\
            \ a single proof to the Ethereum mainnet. This significantly reduces the\
            \ computational load on the Ethereum network and enhances its scalability.\
            \ Examples8\n\n^ zkSync is also the name of a specific project that has\
            \ been developed to implement this method. It is initiated and maintained\
            \ by Matter Labs, a company focused on improving the scalability and usability\

            # 4Recursive zk proofs\n\nA technique that allows for the aggregation\
            \ of multiple proofs into a single proof, drastically reducing the computational\
            \ overhead of verification. This innovation has contributed to improved\
            \ scalability in zk proof systems, making them more efficient for applications\
            \ with a high transaction volume.  Usually, the way it is used is in evolving\
            \ computation: First, it breaks the computation to be proven into smaller\
            \ steps and proves them iteratively. Each step contains a proof, proving\
            \ the current state of the computation. Then, a new proof for the next\
            \ step can be generated by using the current step and its proof recursively\
            \ showing the correctness of all prior steps alltogether. The proof update\
            \ does not require recomputing from the very first step as in a standard\
            \ zk proof, and it is independent of the total length of the computation.\n\

            \ Complexity\n\nZK proofs offer exciting possibilities for privacy, security,\
            \ and efficiency. However, they also come with several technical challenges\
            \ and adoption barriers for researchers, developers, and practitioners\
            \ working in the realm of zk proofs. These multifaceted issues range from\
            \ efficiency and scalability limitations to concerns about security assumptions\
            \ and real world implications. By addressing these challenges, the cryptographic\
            \ community can pave the way for the broader utilization of zk proofs\
            \ in domains ranging from blockchain and cybersecurity to privacypreserving\
            \ technologies and beyond. Here are five challenges currently in focus:\n\
            \nMany zk proof systems involve the use of sophisticated cryptographic\
            \ operations applied to a complex mathematical representation of a computer\
            \ program. This complexity can make it challenging for developers to adopt\
            \ and integrate zk proofs into their applications. It also affects the\
            \ efficiency and scalability of large-scale zk systems.\n\n“The main challenge\
            \ is around the balance of cost, time and proof size. This is the Holy\
            \ Grail: to generate a proof with zero overhead and super small proof\
            \ size. Now, we have achieved super small proof sizes, but with other\
            \ big trade-offs. Generally the trade-off is: it becomes more expensive.”\n\
            \nNicola Greco, research scientist, CryptoNet\n\n# 2Scalability\n\nWhile\
            \ zk proofs can aggregate multiple proofs and transactions, scalability\
            \ challenges can arise when dealing with a high volume of transactions.\
            \ Generating and verifying a large number of proofs may introduce bottlenecks.\
            \ Achieving strong privacy guarantees through zk proofs might involve\
            \ trade-offs in terms of transaction speed, network overhead, or computational\
            \ load. Striking the right balance between privacy and performance is\
            \ crucial.\n\nResearch scientist Rosario Gennaro explains that building\
            \ a zk proof involves running a program that stores the state of the virtual\
            \ machine at every step of the proof, making space a bottleneck to growth\
            \ and speed of transaction. Folding schemes present a solution for proofs\
            \ that are computed at every step of a computation: given a proof with\
            \ correct computation up to, for example, step 4, the next correctness\
            \ proof is obtain by \"folding\" the proof of correctness of step 5 into\
            \ the previous proof, without the need to store the state of the computation\
            \ at every stage.\n\nRosario Gennaro, Professor at The City University\
            \ of New York\n\n“Instead of writing the entire transcript for the computation\
            \ down at each step, folding compresses the computation and solves the\
            \ space problem. There is a lot of work happening on implementing folding\
            \ schemes to build efficient zk virtual machines, ranging from Web2 companies\
            \ like Microsoft to cutting edge startups like Lurk Lab. While this bottleneck\
            \ hasn’t been fully resolved, it’s one area where we are ahead of the\
            \ curve to solve the issue and definitely an area to watch.”\n\n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/51f435ef-380f-4993-bc3b-af6993a2d51d/images/370bc7f5887fac864386679801cf1ffab6db8b6348a297eca19eca6642988b8e.jpg)\n\
            \n# 3Trusted Setup\n\nSome zk proof systems require a trusted setup phase\
            \ to generate initial parameters. The trusted setup phase requires that\
            \ the individuals or entity responsible for generating these parameters\
            \ act honestly and do not keep any secret information that could compromise\
            \ the security of the system. If this setup is compromised or not performed\
            \ correctly, it can undermine the security and privacy guarantees of the\
            \ system. The field of zk proofs is rapidly evolving, with new advancements\
            \ and potential vulnerabilities regularly emerging. Continuous research\
            \ and development are essential to address security issues and improve\
            \ the efficiency of zk proof systems.\n\n# 4Interoperability\n\nDifferent\
            \ zk proof systems might use distinct standards and protocols, making\
            \ it challenging to achieve interoperability between different systems.\
            \ Creating common standards would enhance compatibility and efforts are\
            \ currently underway with the likes of The ZKProof Community. ZK proofs\
            \ also often come with proof sizes that can be large, making them less\
            \ efficient to transmit and store. Efforts to minimize proof size while\
            \ maintaining security are ongoing. To support standardization, Polybase\
            \ has released a new zk benchmark site,  [https://zkbench.dev/](https://zkbench.dev/),\
            \ with detailed comparison tables and open community reviews.\n\n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/51f435ef-380f-4993-bc3b-af6993a2d51d/images/df233b43e2367705b1d403af7683e60927bdac7de5c1e23a174e60a5cd9ea30b.jpg)\n\
            \nSid Gandhi, co-founder of Polybase “We're at that phase in the industry\
            \ where people understand the high level capability, like keeping data\
            \ private, proving things publicly, but there is still a big educational\
            \ aspect around the trade-offs and the technical implementation, and,\
            \ potentially, what other options are available, what trade-offs exist\
            \ with those options as well. So, we are doing quite a bit of education.\
            \ And then, the next step after that is selling our actual product. So\

            \nElan Neiger, head of marketing, Ingonyama\n\n“Today's hardware is not\
            \ built for zero knowledge. ZK proofs require a massive amount of computational\
            \ resources and existing hardware (CPUs, GPUs) are not designed to handle\
            \ this computation efficiently. The main bottleneck is proof generation,\
            \ which is still too slow and expensive. In terms of timing, zk algorithms\
            \ have been developed for four decades, and zk software engineering for\
            \ about 10 years. The missing ingredient is specialized hardware in order\

            \ comes from the blockchain industry for scaling and privacy, but what\
            \ makes me even more excited for zk proofs is the fact that once we get\
            \ outside of the Web3 ecosystem, zk can impact nearly every industry,\
            \ from medical research to AI, to decentralized ID, to new online multiplayer\
            \ gaming architectures, and beyond.”\n\n# 08\\. The Future of ZK Proofs\n\
            \n# 1Seamlessness\n\nThe industry is evolving at a rapid pace, with a\
            \ focus on moving from research to a business-led model. On one hand,\
            \ the near future is focused on addressing challenges and roadblocks in\
            \ this space, which include hardware acceleration and faster computation.\
            \ Here, PL network teams share their top three projections for the zk\
            \ proof space in the near future.\n\nIn the next 2-5 years, Rarify Labs\
            \ expects an era of widespread integration of zk proofs across multiple\
            \ protocols and technologies. Its presence will revolutionize privacy,\
            \ digital identities, and blockchain performance, all while being seamless\
            \ and mostly invisible to users, similar to the way SSL and secure enclaves\
            \ in phones are invisible to users. ZK technology will have a user-centric\
            \ flow that enables scaling and accessibility across the digital identity\
            \ space.\n\n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/51f435ef-380f-4993-bc3b-af6993a2d51d/images/68d667d380b1ab01e607a08caf04b6546a27c8d101ac63eeb9e219caa4d6004d.jpg)\n\
            \nKitty Horlick, Director, Rarify Labs\n\n“ZK proofs will help dissolve\
            \ the boundaries between Web2 and Web3, particularly within the identity\
            \ space as it is currently the only technology that sits across both realms.\
            \ More generally, zk proofs will massively reduce computation complexity\
            \ and help deliver truly performant blockchains.”\n\n# 2Client side integration\n\
            \nIn the ever-evolving landscape of cryptography, Ingonyama believes zk\
            \ proofs will transcend server-side applications and find their place\
            \ within the very devices we carry in our pockets. Imagine the power of\
            \ a world with zk proof hardware embedded directly in your mobile device,\
            \ capable of running a proof of ownership or proof of personhood.\n\n\
            “We envision a future in which zk is not just running on the server side\
            \ like data centers and cloud, but also on the client side – in mobile\
            \ phones and gaming machines. ZK technology is fundamental to trustless\
            \ compute. We're working to make efficient, zk proof hardware accelerators\
            \ that can run everywhere.” said Elan Neiger, marketing lead at Ingonyama.\n\
            \n# Cost efficient proofs\n\nAs zk proof methods evolve and proofs themselves\
            \ become smaller in size and more cost effective, they will become an\
            \ attractive option within the realm of the Internet of Things (IoT).\
            \ Currently, IoT devices store all their data in centralized storage and\
            \ data is stored directly onto their servers. ZK proofs allow for proofs\
            \ to be used in place of stored data, creating efficiencies and cutting\
            \ costs.\n\n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/51f435ef-380f-4993-bc3b-af6993a2d51d/images/9aff3383de21b1456b531420a3159a5518249a442de87a435f9a2a4fde2963ce.jpg)\n\
            \nElan Neiger, head of marketing, Ingonyama\n\n“Another focus for the\
            \ future of zk lies with the Internet of Things (IoT). With zero knowledge,\
            \ it will be possible to cut the costs of data storage, by sending proofs\
            \ instead of data to confirm that specific stages or conditions have been\
            \ met. Zero-Knowledge also allows for yes /  no answers to complex questions\
            \ involving data or sensitive personal information. For example: do you\
            \ have enough money in your bank account to buy this car - Yes or no? \
            \ ZK today is still a small market, but growing, because it is the most\
            \ powerful cryptography that exists for hiding data, while allowing for\
            \ assertions on that data.”\n\nEducation and standardization are key to\
            \ the evolution of zk proofs. To that end, Ingonyama launched an open\
            \ source community effort in August 2023: Ingopedia, a repo for all things\
            \ zk for beginners and experts, ranging from video tutorials to academic\
            \ research (link). Ingopedia has been widely cited as a good place to\
            \ dive into the deep end of zero knowledge.\n\n# Potential Disruptors\n\
            \nAs the industry evolves, researchers and developers are keeping an eye\
            \ out for potential disruptors. These include quantum computers, homomorphic\
            \ encryption and interdisciplinary innovations:\n\n# 1Quantum Computing\n\
            \nIf large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers become a reality, they\
            \ could potentially break certain cryptographic primitives that underpin\
            \ zk proofs. However, should quantum computing become a reality, we will\
            \ have to change all the deployed cryptographic schemes. There is already\
            \ great progress with quantum-resistant encryption to date and industry\
            \ leaders are making strides with quantum resistant SNARKs as well.\n\n\
            Rosario Gennaro, Professor at The City University of New York\n\n“All\
            \ is not lost with the advent of quantum computing. In the future, we\
            \ will see quantum resistant SNARKs. We know how to do quantum resistant\
            \ encryption at this point. Should a quantum computer show up tomorrow,\
            \ it will change everything. It won’t happen overnight, but we'll get\
            \ there.”\n\n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/51f435ef-380f-4993-bc3b-af6993a2d51d/images/983de6d97fe9c2c49af38b307b680e4a4235924a6f268d216ab0a1dada2ea027.jpg)\n\
            \n# 2Homomorphic Encryption\n\nFully homomorphic encryption (FHE) allows\
            \ computations to be performed on encrypted data without the need to decrypt\
            \ it. FHE and zk proofs serve different roles in cryptography, and their\
            \ use cases often complement each other rather than disrupt each other.\
            \ While FHE can be used for secure computation and privacy-preserving\
            \ data analysis, zk proofs are typically employed for proving statements\
            \ about data or knowledge without revealing that data or knowledge. However,\
            \ if zk proofs over FHE computations were deployed, it could enable a\
            \ new level of privacy-preserving computation, where not only the data,\
            \ but also the operations performed on the data remain hidden. This would\
            \ have significant implications for secure cloud computing, private data\
            \ analysis, and more.\n\nActively building in this space, PL network team\
            \ Zama is building an open source framework that enables developers to\
            \ use homomorphic encryption to secure their Web2 and Web3 apps, without\
            \ having to know cryptography. The homomorphic programs can then be deployed\
            \ locally, to the cloud or to their upcoming decentralized infrastructure.\n\
            \n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/51f435ef-380f-4993-bc3b-af6993a2d51d/images/98fdf9e11e6ad299d5f85c1ec009ce7878ab8177d0a8632d2432904bf17881b4.jpg)\n\
            \nRand Hindi, co-founder of Zama\n\n“While zk’s strength is in verifiability,\
            \ FHE focuses on privacy. When you combine the two together, you have\
            \ the ideal solution, because you can have confidential computing that\
            \ is actually verified. And so it's an area we’re very excited about.\
            \ But zk has difficulty scaling existing tech. The way you implement zk\
            \ is complicated, you have to resort to incredibly complex protocols.\
            \ By contrast, FHE is just a smart contract running on-chain, like every\
            \ other smart contract. But again, FHE cannot do what zk does, which is\
            \ to prove that a computation is correct. This is why the future will\
            \ likely see compatibility between the two, with zk for verifiability\
            \ and FHE for privacy.”\n\n# 3Interdisciplinary Innovations\n\nAs the\
            \ adoption of zk proofs expands, experts from various fields may come\
            \ together to create novel applications and protocols. For example, collaborations\
            \ between cryptographers, blockchain developers, AI researchers, and economists\
            \ could lead to innovative solutions that we can't foresee yet. This cross-pollination\
            \ of ideas might result in entirely new use cases and disruptive applications\
            \ for zk proofs.\n\n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/51f435ef-380f-4993-bc3b-af6993a2d51d/images/25e6b848b72a1c419ad0c91a28797ad4c7404336caf47050d34410f394dc8b9c.jpg)\n\
            \nHarry Grieve, Co-Founder of Gensyn “Platforms will mature to the point\
            \ where they’re ready for production use and then (hopefully) many applications\
            \ will start appearing beyond the current under-the-hood/ scalability\
            \ systems like zkEVMs or the current iteration of Starknet. We’re most\
            \ excited about the applications in machine learning.”\n\nRecommendations\
            \ & Advice\n\n# Stay Updated with Research\n\nZero knowledge proofs is\
            \ an evolving field with constant advancements. Stay updated with the\
            \ latest research papers, conferences, and discussions in cryptography\
            \ and related domains to remain informed about new techniques and developments.\n\
            \n# Experiment and Prototype\n\nStart by experimenting with existing zk\
            \ proof libraries and tools. Creating prototypes will give you hands-on\
            \ experience and help you grasp the practical aspects of using zk proofs.\
            \ Collaborate with other researchers, developers, and experts in the field.\
            \ It's a great way to learn the strengths and limitations of different\
            \ zk proof systems.\n\n# Focus on Real-World Applications\n\nWhile theoretical\
            \ research is important, also consider practical applications. Think about\
            \ how zk proofs can solve real-world problems like privacy-preserving\
            \ data sharing, secure authentication, or improving blockchain scalability.\n\
            \nNicola Greco, research scientist, CryptoNet\n\n“After many years, we\
            \ finally have efficient proof schemes. By efficient, I mean that the\
            \ prover time versus the normal computation time is getting closer and\
            \ closer. The closer we get, the more we can have more applications that\
            \ can be verified. In 2023, it's close enough to verify blockchain transactions.\
            \ And maybe in the future, it can be closer to verify any computation.”\n\

            \nThe digital transformation is reshaping numerous sectors of the economy,\
            \ and real estate is no exception. By 2025, AI will no longer be a mere\
            \ gadget but a powerful tool that facilitates customer interactions, streamlines\
            \ decision-making processes, and optimizes sales operations. Simultaneously,\
            \ blockchain technology ensures security, transparency, and scalability\
            \ in transactions. With this article, we launch a series of publications\
            \ exploring AI in business, focusing today on the application of artificial\
            \ intelligence within the real estate industry.\n\n## AI vs. Tradition:\
            \ Key Implementations of AI in Real Estate\n\nDesigning, selling, and\
            \ managing properties—traditional methods are increasingly giving way\
            \ to data-driven decision-making.\n\n![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\n###\
            \ Breakthroughs in Customer Service\n\nAI-powered chatbots and virtual\
            \ assistants are revolutionizing how companies interact with their customers.\
            \ These tools handle hundreds of inquiries simultaneously, personalize\
            \ offers, and guide clients through the purchasing process. Implementing\
            \ AI agents can lead to higher-quality leads for developers and automate\
            \ responses to most standard customer queries. However, technical challenges\
            \ in deploying such systems include:\n\n- Integration with existing real\
            \ estate databases: Chatbots must have access to up-to-date listings,\
            \ prices, and availability.\n- Personalization of communication: Systems\
            \ must adapt their interactions to individual customer needs.\n- Management\
            \ of industry-specific knowledge: Chatbots require specialized expertise\
            \ about local real estate markets.\n\n### Advanced Data Analysis\n\nCognitive\
            \ AI systems utilize deep learning to analyze complex relationships within\
            \ the real estate market, such as macroeconomic trends, local zoning plans,\
            \ and user behavior on social media platforms. Deploying such solutions\
            \ necessitates:\n\n- Collecting high-quality historical data.\n- Building\
            \ infrastructure for real-time data processing.\n- Developing appropriate\
            \ machine learning models.\n- Continuously monitoring and updating models\
            \ based on new data.\n\n### Intelligent Design\n\nGenerative artificial\
            \ intelligence is revolutionizing architectural design. These advanced\
            \ algorithms can produce dozens of building design variants that account\
            \ for site constraints, legal requirements, energy efficiency considerations,\
            \ and aesthetic preferences.\n\n### Optimizing Building Energy Efficiency\n\
            \nSmart building management systems (BMS) leverage AI to optimize energy\
            \ consumption while maintaining resident comfort. Reinforcement learning\
            \ algorithms analyze data from temperature, humidity, and air quality\
            \ sensors to adjust heating, cooling, and ventilation parameters effectively.\n\
            \n## Integration of AI with Blockchain in Real Estate\n\nThe convergence\
            \ of AI with blockchain technology opens up new possibilities for the\
            \ real estate sector. Blockchain is a distributed database where information\
            \ is stored in immutable \"blocks.\" It ensures transaction security and\
            \ data transparency while AI analyzes these data points to derive actionable\
            \ insights. In practice, this means that ownership histories, all transactions,\
            \ and property modifications are recorded in an unalterable format, with\
            \ AI aiding in interpreting these records and informing decision-making\
            \ processes.\n\n## The Future of AI in Real Estate: Trends and Forecasts\n\
            \nAI has the potential to bring significant value to the real estate sector—estimated\
            \ between $110 billion and $180 billion by experts at [McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/).\n\
            \n![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nKey development directions over the coming\
            \ years include:\n\n- Autonomous negotiation systems: AI agents equipped\
            \ with game theory strategies capable of conducting complex negotiations.\n\
            - AI in urban planning: Algorithms designed to plan city development and\
            \ optimize spatial allocation.\n- [Property tokenization](https://nextrope.com/tokenization-the-future-of-real-estate/):\
            \ Leveraging blockchain technology to divide properties into digital tokens\
            \ that enable fractional investment opportunities.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\
            For companies today, the question is no longer \"if\" but \"how\" to implement\
            \ AI to maximize benefits and enhance competitiveness. A strategic approach\
            \ begins with identifying specific business challenges followed by selecting\
            \ appropriate technologies.\n\nWhat values could AI potentially bring\
            \ to your organization?\n\n- Reduction of operational costs through automation\n\
            - Enhanced customer experience and shorter transaction times\n- Increased\

            \ New Heights\n\n![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nGracjan Prusik\n\n11 Mar\
            \ 2025\n\n![AI-Driven Frontend Automation: Elevating Developer Productivity\
            \ to New Heights](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\n* * *\n\n## AI Revolution\
            \ in the Frontend Developer's Workshop\n\nIn today's world, programming\
            \ without AI support means giving up a powerful tool that radically increases\
            \ a developer's productivity and efficiency. For the modern developer,\
            \ AI in frontend automation is not just a curiosity, but a key tool that\
            \ enhances productivity. From automatically generating components, to\
            \ refactoring, and testing – AI tools are fundamentally changing our daily\
            \ work, allowing us to focus on the creative aspects of programming instead\
            \ of the tedious task of writing repetitive code. In this article, I will\
            \ show how these tools are most commonly used to work faster, smarter,\
            \ and with greater satisfaction.\n\nThis post kicks off a **series dedicated\
            \ to the use of AI in frontend automation**, where we will analyze and\
            \ discuss **specific tools, techniques, and practical use cases of AI**\
            \ that help developers in their everyday tasks.\n\n## AI in Frontend Automation\
            \ – How It Helps with Code Refactoring\n\nOne of the most common uses\
            \ of AI is improving code quality and finding errors. These tools can\
            \ analyze code and suggest optimizations. As a result, we will be able\
            \ to write code much faster and significantly reduce the risk of human\
            \ error.\n\n**How AI Saves Us from Frustrating Bugs**\n\nImagine this\
            \ situation: you spend hours debugging an application, not understanding\
            \ why data isn't being fetched. Everything seems correct, the syntax is\
            \ fine, yet something isn't working. Often, the problem lies in small\
            \ details that are hard to catch when reviewing the code.\n\nLet’s take\
            \ a look at an example:\n\n``` line-numbers\nfunction fetchData() {\n\
            \    fetch(\"htts://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts\")\n      .then((response)\
            \ => response.json())\n      .then((data) => console.log(data))\n    \
            \  .catch((error) => console.error(error));\n}\n```\n\nAt first glance,\
            \ the code looks correct. However, upon running it, no data is retrieved.\
            \ Why? There’s a typo in the URL – \"htts\" instead of \"https.\" This\
            \ is a classic example of an error that could cost a developer hours of\
            \ frustrating debugging.\n\nWhen we ask AI to refactor this code, not\
            \ only will we receive a more readable version using newer patterns (async/await),\
            \ but also – and most importantly – AI will automatically detect and fix\
            \ the typo in the URL:\n\n``` line-numbers\nasync function fetchPosts()\
            \ {\n    try {\n      const response = await fetch(\n        \"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts\"\
            \n      );\n      const data = await response.json();\n      console.log(data);\n\
            \    } catch (error) {\n      console.error(error);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\
            ## How AI in Frontend Automation Speeds Up UI Creation\n\n**One of the\
            \ most obvious applications of AI in frontend development is generating\
            \ UI components.** Tools like [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot),\
            \ [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/), or [Claude](https://claude.ai/) can\
            \ generate component code based on a short description or an image provided\
            \ to them.\n\nWith these tools, we can create complex user interfaces\
            \ in just a few seconds. Generating a complete, functional UI component\
            \ often takes less than a minute. Furthermore, the generated code is typically\
            \ error-free, includes appropriate animations, and is fully responsive,\
            \ adapting to different screen sizes. It is important to describe exactly\
            \ what we expect.\n\nHere’s a view generated by [Claude](https://claude.ai/)\
            \ after entering the request: “Based on the loaded data, display posts.\
            \ The page should be responsive. The main colors are: #CCFF89, #151515,\
            \ and #E4E4E4.”\n\n![Generated posts view](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\n\
            ## AI in Code Analysis and Understanding\n\nAI can analyze existing code\
            \ and help understand it, which is particularly useful in large, complex\
            \ projects or code written by someone else.\n\n**Example: Generating a\
            \ summary of a function's behavior**\n\nLet’s assume we have a function\
            \ for processing user data, the workings of which we don’t understand\
            \ at first glance. AI can analyze the code and generate a readable explanation:\n\
            \n``` line-numbers\nfunction processUserData(users) {\n  return users\n\
            \    .filter(user => user.isActive) // Checks the `isActive` value for\
            \ each user and keeps only the objects where `isActive` is true\n    .map(user\
            \ => ({\n      id: user.id, // Retrieves the `id` value from each user\
            \ object\n      name: `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`, // Creates\
            \ a new string by combining `firstName` and `lastName`\n      email: user.email.toLowerCase(),\
            \ // Converts the email address to lowercase\n    }));\n}\n```\n\nIn this\
            \ case, AI not only summarizes the code's functionality but also breaks\
            \ down individual operations into easier-to-understand segments.\n\n##\
            \ AI in Frontend Automation – Translations and Error Detection\n\nEvery\
            \ frontend developer knows that programming isn’t just about creatively\
            \ building interfaces—it also involves many repetitive, tedious tasks.\
            \ One of these is implementing translations for multilingual applications\
            \ (i18n). Adding translations for each key in JSON files and then verifying\
            \ them can be time-consuming and error-prone.\n\nHowever, AI can significantly\
            \ speed up this process. Using [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/), [DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com/),\
            \ or [Claude](https://claude.ai/) allows for automatic generation of translations\
            \ for the user interface, as well as detecting linguistic and stylistic\
            \ errors.\n\n**Example:**\n\nWe have a translation file in JSON format:\n\
            \n```json line-numbers\n{\n  \"welcome_message\": \"Welcome to our application!\"\
            ,\n  \"logout_button\": \"Log out\",\n  \"error_message\": \"Something\
            \ went wrong. Please try again later.\"\n}\n```\n\nAI can automatically\
            \ generate its Polish version:\n\n```json line-numbers\n{\n  \"welcome_message\"\
            : \"Witaj w naszej aplikacji!\",\n  \"logout_button\": \"Wyloguj się\"\
            ,\n  \"error_message\": \"Coś poszło nie tak. Spróbuj ponownie później.\"\
            \n}\n```\n\nMoreover, AI can detect spelling errors or inconsistencies\
            \ in translations. For example, if one part of the application uses \"\
            Log out\" and another says \"Exit,\" AI can suggest unifying the terminology.\n\
            \nThis type of automation not only saves time but also minimizes the risk\
            \ of human errors. And this is just one example – AI also assists in generating\
            \ documentation, writing tests, and optimizing performance, which **we\
            \ will discuss in upcoming articles**.\n\n## Summary\n\nArtificial intelligence\
            \ is transforming the way frontend developers work daily. From generating\
            \ components and refactoring code to detecting errors, automating testing,\
            \ and documentation—AI significantly accelerates and streamlines the development\
            \ process. Without these tools, we would lose a lot of valuable time,\
            \ which we certainly want to avoid.\n\nIn the next parts of this series,\
            \ we will cover topics such as:\n\n- [**How does AI speed up UI component\

            # What is Zero-Knowledge Proof - a hot technology bringing trustworthiness
            to Web3 privacy?


            Recently, "zero-knowledge proof" is attracting attention. In 2019, the
            World Economic Forum announced zero-knowledge proof as one of the five
            privacy-enhancing technologies that bring new value to the financial sector
            (\*1). Why is this idea, invented in the 1980s, receiving attention now?
            This article gives an overview of the technology, examples of its application,
            and looks into its future.

            ## What is Zero-Knowledge Proof?


            Zero-knowledge proof; ZKP is a technology in which a person who wants
            to prove something (Prover; hereafter referred to as P) proves the fact
            that he knows the knowledge without giving any other knowledge to the
            person who wants to verify it (Verifier; hereafter referred to as V).


            As a result, V can only verify the fact that P knows the knowledge without
            obtaining any other knowledge (Figure 1).


            ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img01.png?h=378&iar=0&w=800&rev=6d7d71ac7c564b25984a2df33508640b)


            Figure 1: Concept of Zero-Knowledge Proof



            In the real world, when you want to assert that you hold certain credentials,
            it is common to present evidence to convince the other person that you
            hold the credentials.


            However, when you do so, the other person may be presented with too much
            information about what you want to prove, such as your address or age
            in the evidence. If you cannot trust the other person, you may feel uncomfortable
            giving them too much information. However, if you don''t show them the
            evidence, they are unlikely to trust your claim. How can you convince
            someone that you hold the qualification without giving them extra information?


            The technology to achieve this is zero-knowledge proof. The idea of zero-knowledge
            proof originated in cryptography research in the 1980s (\*2).


            - (\*2) [Goldwasser, S., Micali, S., Rackoff, C.: "The knowledge complexity
            of interactive proof-systems," STOC 1985.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/22145.22178)



            The claims that can be proven with zero-knowledge proof are knowledge
            about propositions. A proposition is a verbal expression of a judgment
            that is clearly true or false (\*3).


            - (\*3)

            For example, "2023 is equal to 7×17×17" is a proposition, and it is a
            true fact. "I know the prime factorization of 2023" is knowledge related
            to the stated proposition and is an example of a claim that can be used
            for zero-knowledge proof. On the other hand, "2023 is a large number"
            is subjective and not a proposition. Therefore, the claim that "I know
            2023 is a big number" is not a subject of zero-knowledge proof.



            In general, a zero-knowledge proof must satisfy three properties: completeness,
            soundness, and zero-knowledge (Table 1).


            | Nature | Overview |

            | --- | --- |

            | Completeness | If the prover is correct, it will be determined to be
            correct by the verifier |

            | Soundness | If the prover is incorrect, it must be determined to be
            incorrect by the verifier with a high probability |

            | Zero-Knowledge | The verifier cannot obtain any knowledge other than
            the fact that the prover wants to prove |


            Table 1: Requirements for a zero-knowledge proof


            ## Intuitive understanding of Zero-Knowledge Proofs


            Here are two examples to help you understand zero-knowledge proofs intuitively.


            ### 1\. The cave problem


            This explanation was introduced in the paper "How to explain zero-knowledge
            protocols to your children" (\*4).


            - (\*4) [Jean-Jacques Quisquater et al., "How to Explain Zero-Knowledge
            Protocols to Your Children," CRYPTO 1989. (PDF: 227KB)](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~mkowalcz/628.pdf)


            Inside the cave is a magic door that opens when you say the password.
            The prover P knows the password and gives it in exchange for money. The
            door is at the far end of the cave shown in Figure 2. There are two paths
            to the door, A and B. The person who knows the password can open the door
            and move from A to B or vice versa.


            ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img02.jpg?h=453&iar=0&w=800&rev=cf4c7228935441d3b38f0fd9442af117)


            Figure 2: The Cave Problem



            V, the verifier, wants to buy the password, but he doubts whether P really
            knows the password and cannot start a transaction. If P can convince V
            that P knows the secret password without telling V the secret password
            itself, V can start a transaction. So, here''s what they are trying to
            do.


            First, V waits outside the cave. Then P enters the cave, randomly chooses
            either path A or B, and goes to the door (Figure 3).


            ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img03.jpg?h=533&iar=0&w=800&rev=0918e3fa17984bbe8d735ff3c9df3166)


            Figure 3: Prover P''s Random Selection



            Next, V enters the cave, goes to the branching point of the paths, randomly
            chooses A or B in their head, and shouts to P to come out from the chosen
            path (Figure 4).


            ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img04.jpg?h=401&iar=0&w=800&rev=945bfc0651e54daea0b604e2edd6f2a4)


            Figure 4: Verifier V''s Random Selection



            If P knows the password:


            P can use the password to open the door and come out of the designated
            path, whichever way V tells him to go (Figure 5). This means completeness.


            ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img05.jpg?h=466&iar=0&w=800&rev=6088ed6bec1c4fd3a3ac05b15c69a53a)


            Figure 5: The Case that Prover P Knows the Password



            If P does not know the password:


            P can only come out of the path he entered, so the probability of coming
            out of the path chosen by V is 50%. If they repeat this process over and
            over again, it''s almost impossible for P to fool V every time (Figure
            6). For example, if they try 30 times, the probability that P can fool
            V is about 0.0000001%. This means soundness.


            ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img06.jpg?h=421&iar=0&w=800&rev=db7f0b94506a47679157cddc1b1a33bf)


            Figure 6: The Case that Prover P Does Not Know the Password



            So, if P succeeds on all his attempts, V must be convinced that P knows
            the password. If V tries even more, he can get his chance of being cheated
            as close to 0% as V wants. At this time, V will not gain any knowledge
            about the password. This means zero-knowledge.


            Literally, what P wants to prove has been proved to V with zero-knowledge.


            ### 2\. The Problem of Finding a Seabird


            Professor Amit Sahai of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)
            explains the concept of zero-knowledge proof on YouTube to children, teenagers,
            college students, graduate students, and experts in five different difficulty
            levels (\*5). Here is a child-friendly explanations that will help you
            get a sense of the main points.


            - (\*5) [Computer Scientist Explains One Concept in 5 Levels of Difficulty,
            WIRED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOGdb1CTu5c)


            The professor shows the child a picture. The picture shows a crowd of
            hundreds of penguins. He says, "There is one puffin (a penguin-like seabird),
            and I know where it is, but I don''t want to tell you. Do you believe
            me? I''m going to prove it without revealing its location."


            ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img07.jpg?h=505&iar=0&w=800&rev=3f05fc0c1f934735a75fbbae8353800f)


            Figure 7: The Problem of Finding a Seabird



            The professor pulls out a piece of black paper several times larger than
            the photo. The paper has a small hole, and the photo is pasted on the
            back of the paper so that the hole matches the position of the puffin.
            The child looks into the hole and says, "I see a puffin". But the child
            can''t see the position of the photo on the back of the paper, so she
            can''t tell where the puffin is in the original photo. "This is an example
            of a zero-knowledge proof," the professor explains (Figure 8).


            ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img08.jpg?h=370&iar=0&w=800&rev=46de5598e3f64c609c0c7fd1a156c661)


            Figure 8: Zero-Knowledge Proof for the Problem of Finding a Seabird



            This exchange satisfies completeness because a professor who knows the
            location of the puffin can always prove it.


            Furthermore, it satisfies soundness because if the professor does not
            know the location of the puffin, the cheating will be exposed with a high
            probability if the child looks into the hole and confirms it.


            Furthermore, it satisfies zero-knowledge because the child cannot obtain
            any knowledge other than the fact that the professor knows the location
            of the puffin.


            ## Social Application Examples


            This paper introduces an application example of zero-knowledge proof to
            society and considers prospects.


            ### 1\. Blockchain Privacy Enhancement


            Blockchain is widely used in society, a representative example being virtual
            currencies. Its transparency is maintained by decentralized management
            of its ledger by all participants in the blockchain. However, due to its
            high transparency, securing user privacy may be a challenge.


            In recent years, zero-knowledge proofs have begun to be used to improve
            blockchain privacy. For example, in the case of cryptocurrencies, methods
            known collectively as zk-SNARK (\*6) and zk-STARK (\*7) have begun to
            be introduced as zero-knowledge proofs to show that the transaction operation
            was indeed performed, without disclosing the transaction contents such
            as the sender, recipient, and remittance amount.


            In addition, zero-knowledge proofs have attracted even more attention
            because they can contribute to speeding up blockchain processing.

            - (\*7)

            zk-STARK: Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge



            ### 2\. Proof of Income Range


            In November 2017, ING, a major Dutch bank, developed zero-knowledge range
            proofs (ZKRP) (\*8). ZKRP is an application of zero-knowledge proofs.
            ZKRP can prove that a numerical value, such as an amount of money, is
            within a certain range without showing the numerical value to the other
            party. For example, mortgage applicants can prove that their income is
            within a certain range required by loan screening without telling the
            income itself.

            ### 3\. Selective Disclosure of Attribute Information


            The W3C, which standardizes Web technologies, has standardized a data
            model for the concept of verifiable credentials (VC) (\*9). It introduces
            zero-knowledge proof, in which you select your attribute information and
            prove only that the attribute satisfies certain conditions.


            For example, it shows a use case in which you select and prove only the
            information that a university graduate received a degree without revealing
            his or her identity or other unnecessary personal information.


            - (\*9) [W3C Recommendation, Verifiable Credentials Data Model v1.1, 2022.](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#zero-knowledge-proofs)



            VC is currently being discussed in the "Trusted Web" initiative led by
            the Cabinet Secretariat of Japan. It shows the expectation of zero-knowledge
            proof as a method to realize selective disclosure of data(\*10).


            - (\*10) [Secretariat of the Headquarters for Digital Market Competition,
            the Cabinet Secretariat of Japan, "Trusted Web White Paper Ver 2.0, Overview"
            August 2022 (PDF: 1.7MB)](https://www.kantei.go.jp/jp/singi/digitalmarket/pdf_e/Trusted_Web_White_Paper_ver2.0_Overview.pdf)


            ### 4\. User Authentication


            Currently, ID and password authentication is mainly used for websites
            of various services. However, since the string length of a password is
            limited to a range that can be remembered or managed by the human brain,
            it is vulnerable to brute-force and password-list-type attacks.


            Furthermore, if an attacker takes over the server, not only the password
            itself, but also information useful for guessing the password is leaked,
            which becomes a hint for the attacker, and the password may be leaked
            in the future. If user authentication is implemented with zero-knowledge
            proof, the server can be more secure because no information related to
            the password exists from the beginning.


            As a zero-knowledge proof that can be applied to user authentication,
            there is the Schnorr protocol (\*11). In this method, knowledge about
            the solution of a mathematically difficult problem called the discrete
            logarithm problem is assumed to be information that only the user can
            know and is authenticated with zero-knowledge proof. Compared with the
            ID and password method, this method has not been adopted in the world
            for many years due to its disadvantages such as high communication volume,
            slow processing speed, and "The size of the data to be kept secret is
            too large for humans to remember."


            - (\*11) [IETF, RFC 8235, Schnorr Non-interactive Zero-Knowledge Proof,
            September 2017](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8235)


            In recent years, however, with the spread of technologies such as "faster
            communication networks," "faster processing speeds of servers and terminals,"
            and "memory areas that can be securely stored in smart cards and smartphones,"
            conventional disadvantages are going to be no longer disadvantages.


            ## Prospect


            In recent years, the term "Web3" has attracted attention, and although
            there are various interpretations, its constituent concepts are said to
            be centered on "blockchain," "decentralization" and "decentralized ID."
            Application cases (1) and (2) mentioned above are measures to improve
            the privacy of blockchain, and (3) and (4) are related to decentralization
            and decentralized ID. Therefore, zero-knowledge proof can be said to be
            "a technology that brings trustworthiness to the privacy of Web3."


            In the future, zero-knowledge proof will become an essential technology
            for safe and secure future societies that require a high level of privacy.


            NTT DATA will continue to keep up with the latest trends and accumulate
            and disclose know-hows.

            # Zero-Knowledge Proofs: Emerging Opportunities for the Insurance Industry


            October 2023


            ### **Authors**


            Stefano Chiaradonna (Ph.D. Candidate)


            Petar Jevtić, Ph.D. (PI)


            Dragan Boscovic, Ph.D. (Co-PI)


            ### Description


            Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) represent an innovative suite of cryptographic
            algorithms that empower various parties, especially the insurance community,
            to validate the accuracy of sensitive information without revealing the
            actual information itself. When implemented, it could help the insurance
            industry authenticate policyholders and beneficiaries more efficiently,
            faster and, with fraud prevention mechanisms, it could facilitate communication
            with distribution channels, reinsurers or other stakeholders. Industry
            standards have not yet emerged and various technological solutions offer
            various tradeoffs. Thus, this report introduces the diverse applications
            and emerging opportunities that ZKPs offer to the insurance community,
            especially in the health insurance space.

            ## Description


            Research on blockchain has found that the technology is no silver bullet
            compared to traditional data structures due to limitations regarding decentralization,
            security, and scalability. These limitations are summarized in the blockchain
            trilemma, which today represents the greatest barrier to blockchain adoption
            and applicability. To address these limitations, recent advancements by
            blockchain businesses have focused on a new cryptographic technique called
            "Zero-knowledge proofs". While these primitives have been around for some
            time and despite their potential significance on blockchains, not much
            is known in information systems research about them and their potential
            effects. Therefore, we employ a multivocal literature review to explore
            this new tool and find that although it has the potential to resolve the
            trilemma, it currently only solves it in certain dimensions, which necessitates
            further attention and research.

            description: Research on blockchain has found that the technology is no
              silver bullet compared to traditional data structures due to limitations
              regarding decentralization, security, and scalability. These limitations
              are summarized in the blockchain trilemma, which today represents the
              greatest barrier to blockchain adoption and applicability. To address
              these limitations, recent advancements by blockchain businesses have
              focused on a new cryptographic technique called "Zero-knowledge proofs".
              While these primitives have been around for some time and despite their
              potential significance on blockchains, not much is known in information
              systems research about them and their potential effects. Therefore,
              we employ a multivocal literature review to explore this new tool and
              find that although it has the potential to resolve the trilemma, it
              currently only solves it in certain dimensions, which necessitates further
              attention and research.

            # What is Zero-Knowledge Proof - a hot technology bringing trustworthiness
            to Web3 privacy?


            Recently, "zero-knowledge proof" is attracting attention. In 2019, the
            World Economic Forum announced zero-knowledge proof as one of the five
            privacy-enhancing technologies that bring new value to the financial sector
            (\*1). Why is this idea, invented in the 1980s, receiving attention now?
            This article gives an overview of the technology, examples of its application,
            and looks into its future.

            ## What is Zero-Knowledge Proof?


            Zero-knowledge proof; ZKP is a technology in which a person who wants
            to prove something (Prover; hereafter referred to as P) proves the fact
            that he knows the knowledge without giving any other knowledge to the
            person who wants to verify it (Verifier; hereafter referred to as V).


            As a result, V can only verify the fact that P knows the knowledge without
            obtaining any other knowledge (Figure 1).


            ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img01.png?h=378&iar=0&w=800&rev=6d7d71ac7c564b25984a2df33508640b)


            Figure 1: Concept of Zero-Knowledge Proof



            In the real world, when you want to assert that you hold certain credentials,
            it is common to present evidence to convince the other person that you
            hold the credentials.


            However, when you do so, the other person may be presented with too much
            information about what you want to prove, such as your address or age
            in the evidence. If you cannot trust the other person, you may feel uncomfortable
            giving them too much information. However, if you don''t show them the
            evidence, they are unlikely to trust your claim. How can you convince
            someone that you hold the qualification without giving them extra information?


            The technology to achieve this is zero-knowledge proof. The idea of zero-knowledge
            proof originated in cryptography research in the 1980s (\*2).


            - (\*2) [Goldwasser, S., Micali, S., Rackoff, C.: "The knowledge complexity
            of interactive proof-systems," STOC 1985.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/22145.22178)



            The claims that can be proven with zero-knowledge proof are knowledge
            about propositions. A proposition is a verbal expression of a judgment
            that is clearly true or false (\*3).


            - (\*3)

            For example, "2023 is equal to 7×17×17" is a proposition, and it is a
            true fact. "I know the prime factorization of 2023" is knowledge related
            to the stated proposition and is an example of a claim that can be used
            for zero-knowledge proof. On the other hand, "2023 is a large number"
            is subjective and not a proposition. Therefore, the claim that "I know
            2023 is a big number" is not a subject of zero-knowledge proof.



            In general, a zero-knowledge proof must satisfy three properties: completeness,
            soundness, and zero-knowledge (Table 1).


            | Nature | Overview |

            | --- | --- |

            | Completeness | If the prover is correct, it will be determined to be
            correct by the verifier |

            | Soundness | If the prover is incorrect, it must be determined to be
            incorrect by the verifier with a high probability |

            | Zero-Knowledge | The verifier cannot obtain any knowledge other than
            the fact that the prover wants to prove |


            Table 1: Requirements for a zero-knowledge proof


            ## Intuitive understanding of Zero-Knowledge Proofs


            Here are two examples to help you understand zero-knowledge proofs intuitively.


            ### 1\. The cave problem


            This explanation was introduced in the paper "How to explain zero-knowledge
            protocols to your children" (\*4).


            - (\*4) [Jean-Jacques Quisquater et al., "How to Explain Zero-Knowledge
            Protocols to Your Children," CRYPTO 1989. (PDF: 227KB)](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~mkowalcz/628.pdf)


            Inside the cave is a magic door that opens when you say the password.
            The prover P knows the password and gives it in exchange for money. The
            door is at the far end of the cave shown in Figure 2. There are two paths
            to the door, A and B. The person who knows the password can open the door
            and move from A to B or vice versa.


            ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img02.jpg?h=453&iar=0&w=800&rev=cf4c7228935441d3b38f0fd9442af117)


            Figure 2: The Cave Problem



            V, the verifier, wants to buy the password, but he doubts whether P really
            knows the password and cannot start a transaction. If P can convince V
            that P knows the secret password without telling V the secret password
            itself, V can start a transaction. So, here''s what they are trying to
            do.


            First, V waits outside the cave. Then P enters the cave, randomly chooses
            either path A or B, and goes to the door (Figure 3).


            ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img03.jpg?h=533&iar=0&w=800&rev=0918e3fa17984bbe8d735ff3c9df3166)


            Figure 3: Prover P''s Random Selection



            Next, V enters the cave, goes to the branching point of the paths, randomly
            chooses A or B in their head, and shouts to P to come out from the chosen
            path (Figure 4).


            ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img04.jpg?h=401&iar=0&w=800&rev=945bfc0651e54daea0b604e2edd6f2a4)


            Figure 4: Verifier V''s Random Selection



            If P knows the password:


            P can use the password to open the door and come out of the designated
            path, whichever way V tells him to go (Figure 5). This means completeness.


            ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img05.jpg?h=466&iar=0&w=800&rev=6088ed6bec1c4fd3a3ac05b15c69a53a)


            Figure 5: The Case that Prover P Knows the Password



            If P does not know the password:


            P can only come out of the path he entered, so the probability of coming
            out of the path chosen by V is 50%. If they repeat this process over and
            over again, it''s almost impossible for P to fool V every time (Figure
            6). For example, if they try 30 times, the probability that P can fool
            V is about 0.0000001%. This means soundness.


            ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img06.jpg?h=421&iar=0&w=800&rev=db7f0b94506a47679157cddc1b1a33bf)


            Figure 6: The Case that Prover P Does Not Know the Password



            So, if P succeeds on all his attempts, V must be convinced that P knows
            the password. If V tries even more, he can get his chance of being cheated
            as close to 0% as V wants. At this time, V will not gain any knowledge
            about the password. This means zero-knowledge.


            Literally, what P wants to prove has been proved to V with zero-knowledge.


            ### 2\. The Problem of Finding a Seabird


            Professor Amit Sahai of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)
            explains the concept of zero-knowledge proof on YouTube to children, teenagers,
            college students, graduate students, and experts in five different difficulty
            levels (\*5). Here is a child-friendly explanations that will help you
            get a sense of the main points.


            - (\*5) [Computer Scientist Explains One Concept in 5 Levels of Difficulty,
            WIRED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOGdb1CTu5c)


            The professor shows the child a picture. The picture shows a crowd of
            hundreds of penguins. He says, "There is one puffin (a penguin-like seabird),
            and I know where it is, but I don''t want to tell you. Do you believe
            me? I''m going to prove it without revealing its location."


            ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img07.jpg?h=505&iar=0&w=800&rev=3f05fc0c1f934735a75fbbae8353800f)


            Figure 7: The Problem of Finding a Seabird



            The professor pulls out a piece of black paper several times larger than
            the photo. The paper has a small hole, and the photo is pasted on the
            back of the paper so that the hole matches the position of the puffin.
            The child looks into the hole and says, "I see a puffin". But the child
            can''t see the position of the photo on the back of the paper, so she
            can''t tell where the puffin is in the original photo. "This is an example
            of a zero-knowledge proof," the professor explains (Figure 8).

            This exchange satisfies completeness because a professor who knows the
            location of the puffin can always prove it.


            Furthermore, it satisfies soundness because if the professor does not
            know the location of the puffin, the cheating will be exposed with a high
            probability if the child looks into the hole and confirms it.


            Furthermore, it satisfies zero-knowledge because the child cannot obtain
            any knowledge other than the fact that the professor knows the location
            of the puffin.


            ## Social Application Examples


            This paper introduces an application example of zero-knowledge proof to
            society and considers prospects.


            ### 1\. Blockchain Privacy Enhancement


            Blockchain is widely used in society, a representative example being virtual
            currencies. Its transparency is maintained by decentralized management
            of its ledger by all participants in the blockchain. However, due to its
            high transparency, securing user privacy may be a challenge.


            In recent years, zero-knowledge proofs have begun to be used to improve
            blockchain privacy. For example, in the case of cryptocurrencies, methods
            known collectively as zk-SNARK (\*6) and zk-STARK (\*7) have begun to
            be introduced as zero-knowledge proofs to show that the transaction operation
            was indeed performed, without disclosing the transaction contents such
            as the sender, recipient, and remittance amount.


            In addition, zero-knowledge proofs have attracted even more attention
            because they can contribute to speeding up blockchain processing.

            ### 2\. Proof of Income Range


            In November 2017, ING, a major Dutch bank, developed zero-knowledge range
            proofs (ZKRP) (\*8). ZKRP is an application of zero-knowledge proofs.
            ZKRP can prove that a numerical value, such as an amount of money, is
            within a certain range without showing the numerical value to the other
            party. For example, mortgage applicants can prove that their income is
            within a certain range required by loan screening without telling the
            income itself.

            to blockchain technology](https://www.ingwb.com/en/insights/distributed-ledger-technology/ing-launches-major-addition-to-blockchain-technology)


            ### 3\. Selective Disclosure of Attribute Information


            The W3C, which standardizes Web technologies, has standardized a data
            model for the concept of verifiable credentials (VC) (\*9). It introduces
            zero-knowledge proof, in which you select your attribute information and
            prove only that the attribute satisfies certain conditions.


            For example, it shows a use case in which you select and prove only the
            information that a university graduate received a degree without revealing
            his or her identity or other unnecessary personal information.


            - (\*9) [W3C Recommendation, Verifiable Credentials Data Model v1.1, 2022.](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#zero-knowledge-proofs)



            VC is currently being discussed in the "Trusted Web" initiative led by
            the Cabinet Secretariat of Japan. It shows the expectation of zero-knowledge
            proof as a method to realize selective disclosure of data(\*10).


            - (\*10) [Secretariat of the Headquarters for Digital Market Competition,
            the Cabinet Secretariat of Japan, "Trusted Web White Paper Ver 2.0, Overview"
            August 2022 (PDF: 1.7MB)](https://www.kantei.go.jp/jp/singi/digitalmarket/pdf_e/Trusted_Web_White_Paper_ver2.0_Overview.pdf)


            ### 4\. User Authentication


            Currently, ID and password authentication is mainly used for websites
            of various services. However, since the string length of a password is
            limited to a range that can be remembered or managed by the human brain,
            it is vulnerable to brute-force and password-list-type attacks.


            Furthermore, if an attacker takes over the server, not only the password
            itself, but also information useful for guessing the password is leaked,
            which becomes a hint for the attacker, and the password may be leaked
            in the future. If user authentication is implemented with zero-knowledge
            proof, the server can be more secure because no information related to
            the password exists from the beginning.


            As a zero-knowledge proof that can be applied to user authentication,
            there is the Schnorr protocol (\*11). In this method, knowledge about
            the solution of a mathematically difficult problem called the discrete
            logarithm problem is assumed to be information that only the user can
            know and is authenticated with zero-knowledge proof. Compared with the
            ID and password method, this method has not been adopted in the world
            for many years due to its disadvantages such as high communication volume,
            slow processing speed, and "The size of the data to be kept secret is
            too large for humans to remember."


            - (\*11) [IETF, RFC 8235, Schnorr Non-interactive Zero-Knowledge Proof,
            September 2017](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8235)


            In recent years, however, with the spread of technologies such as "faster
            communication networks," "faster processing speeds of servers and terminals,"
            and "memory areas that can be securely stored in smart cards and smartphones,"
            conventional disadvantages are going to be no longer disadvantages.


            ## Prospect


            In recent years, the term "Web3" has attracted attention, and although
            there are various interpretations, its constituent concepts are said to
            be centered on "blockchain," "decentralization" and "decentralized ID."
            Application cases (1) and (2) mentioned above are measures to improve
            the privacy of blockchain, and (3) and (4) are related to decentralization
            and decentralized ID. Therefore, zero-knowledge proof can be said to be
            "a technology that brings trustworthiness to the privacy of Web3."


            In the future, zero-knowledge proof will become an essential technology
            for safe and secure future societies that require a high level of privacy.


            NTT DATA will continue to keep up with the latest trends and accumulate
            and disclose know-hows.

            Can we trust blockchain to keep our data safe and private? On Feb. 21,
            hackers linked to North Korea’s Lazarus Group ‌stole [$1.5 billion worth
            of Ethereum (ETH)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/beccabratcher/2025/02/25/cryptos-grown-up-response-to-north-koreas-historic-14b-robbery/)
            from the Bybit cold storage multi-signature wallet. Incidents like these
            raise questions: Are [blockchains ‌secure](https://builtin.com/articles/cybersecurity-risks-cross-chain-interoperability)?
            Can privacy and security coexist without sacrificing [decentralization](https://builtin.com/blockchain/decentralized-internet)?


            ## What Is a Zero-Knowledge Proof?


            A zero-knowledge proof is a cryptographic method that allows one party,
            the prover, to prove knowledge of certain information to another party,
            the verifier, without revealing the information itself. It allows blockchain
            users to prove they have enough funds to send a transaction without revealing
            their wallet balance or other sensitive information.


            Imagine sending money or sensitive data online without relying on banks,
            governments, or intermediaries. How can you trust that your information
            or transaction is safe? Blockchain technology addresses this challenge
            through [cryptography](https://builtin.com/articles/cryptography).


            Since the blockchain operates on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network model with
            multiple nodes (computers), cryptography becomes essential for securing
            user transactions and information.


            ## Understanding the Privacy Challenge in Blockchain


            Cryptography secures blockchain networks through encryption, decryption,
            hashing, and digital signatures. While blockchain provides security and
            transparency, it raises privacy concerns because all transaction details
            are visible on [public ledgers](https://builtin.com/cryptocurrency) like
            Bitcoin or Ethereum.


            Consider this scenario: A company makes a large payment to a supplier
            on a public blockchain:


            - The payment amount is visible to competitors

            - The timing of payments reveals business cycles


            This level of transparency is problematic for many real-world applications.

            the Difference](https://builtin.com/blockchain/proof-of-stake-versus-proof-of-work)


            ## Zero-Knowledge Proof: The Privacy Solution for Blockchain


            Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) offer a cryptographic method that enhances
            privacy while maintaining security. As blockchain technology wrestles
            with privacy, many are turning to ZKPs.ZKP allows one party, the prover,
            to prove knowledge of certain information to another party, the verifier,
            without revealing the information itself.


            Let''s say you are at a bar and must prove you are old enough to drink
            without revealing your age. You slide your ID into a special machine that
            verifies your age but hides your personal information. A green light appears,
            proving you are old enough without the bartender ever seeing your birthdate.


            ZKPs do something similar in blockchain. They allow you to prove you have
            enough funds to send a transaction without revealing your wallet balance
            or other sensitive information.


            ## How Zero-Knowledge Proof Works in Blockchain


            1. **You (Prover):**You’re the wallet owner who wants to send ETH.

            2. **Your ID (Wallet Balance):** This represents the information you want
            to keep private.

            3. **Bartender (Blockchain Network):**The network must verify that you
            have enough funds to send the ETH.

            4. **Machine (ZKP System):**This cryptographic process allows verification
            without seeing your balance.

            5. **Green Light (Proof):**The network sees the proof that you have sufficient
            funds and the transaction is approved.


            In action:


            1. You initiate a transaction to send 1 ETH.

            2. Your wallet uses a ZKP system to create proof that you have at least
            1 ETH.

            3. This proof doesn''t reveal your actual wallet balance.

            4. The network validates the proof.

            5. The system approves the transaction. This means you have proven you
            can pay without revealing your wallet details.


            The relationship between cryptography in blockchain and ZKPs is centered
            around enhancing privacy and security. Cryptography in blockchain ensures
            that transactions are secure and tamper-proof, while ZKPs take this a
            step further by allowing parties to verify statements without revealing
            any information.


            This integration helps maintain user privacy and confidentiality in blockchain
            transactions, addressing data exposure and identity protection challenges.


            ZKPs have three essential properties:


            1. **Completeness**: If the statement is true, an honest prover will convince
            an honest verifier. In other words, if you are old enough to drink, the
            machine will always say so.

            2. **Soundness**: If the statement is false, no cheating prover can convince
            an honest verifier that it''s true. If you aren''t old enough, you can''t
            trick the machine into saying you are.

            3. **Zero-Knowledge**: The verifier learns nothing beyond the validity
            of the statement. The bartender only knows if you''re old enough, not
            how old you are.


            ## How Zero-Knowledge Proofs Enhance Blockchain


            ZKPs solve several critical limitations of blockchain:


            ### **1\. Privacy-Preserving Transactions**


            Public blockchains, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, expose transaction details
            (sender, receiver, amount) to everyone. With ZKP, users validate transactions
            without revealing sensitive data. A good example is a Zcash transaction
            where users can prove they have enough funds to send $100 without disclosing
            their balance or the recipient’s address.


            ### **2\. Scalability Through ZK-Rollups**


            Blockchain networks like Ethereum are limited in the number of transactions
            they can process. ZK-Rollups are scaling solutions that bundle hundreds
            of transactions off-chain and submit a single proof to the main blockchain.


            This improves:


            - Higher transaction throughput

            - Lower transaction costs

            - The same security guarantees as the main chain


            ### **3\. Data Confidentiality**


            Beyond transactions, ZKPs can be used to prove the validity of computations
            performed on sensitive data without revealing the data itself. This opens
            up new possibilities for secure data sharing and collaboration on blockchain
            inotherindustries,such as healthcare or finance.


            ### **4\. Interoperability**


            Blockchains struggle to share data securely. ZKPs let chains verify cross-chain
            transactions without exposing full details. For example, Chain A could
            prove to Chain B that a transaction is valid using a ZKP without sharing
            sensitive information.


            ## Challenges of ZKPs in Blockchain


            While ZKPs help enhance blockchain, they present several challenges that
            must be addressed:


            ### **1\. Computational Complexity**


            High computational demands for proof generation and verification can slow
            transaction processing and limit scalability.


            **Solution:** Improve cryptographic techniques and optimize hardware to
            enhance the efficiency of these proofs.


            ### **2\. Trusted Setup Concerns**


            Reliance on a trusted setup in some ZKP systems creates a potential centralization
            point and security vulnerability.


            **Solution:** Develop variants, such as Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent
            Argument of Knowledge (zk-STARKs), that eliminate the need for a trusted
            setup.


            zk-STARKs are a type of ZKP that offers a significant advantage — they
            eliminate the need for a trusted setup. This is a critical security improvement
            because it removes the risk of a single point of failure. Think of it
            like a public election where anyone can independently verify the vote
            count and the validity of the election itself without having to trust
            a central authority.


            ### **3\. Lack of Standardization**


            The absence of uniform implementation standards hinders interoperability
            across blockchain platforms.


            **Solution:** Establish standardized protocols and interoperability frameworks
            for integration. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST),
            a government agency, aims to [standardize ZKPs](https://cryptoslate.com/standards-for-zero-knowledge-proofs-will-matter-in-2025/) in
            2025.


            ### **4\. Implementation Costs**


            High computational requirements and specialized hardware increase the
            cost of implementation.


            **Solution:**Develop more efficient algorithms to reduce costs over time.


            ### **5\. Technical Knowledge**


            The complexity presents a barrier to adoption due to the need for specialized
            expertise and limited developer skills.


            **Solution:** Develop user-friendly tools and frameworks, expand education
            and training opportunities, and simplify integration processes.

            ## Future Security Advancements in Blockchain


            As quantum computers advance, they can break current encryption methods
            used in blockchains today. Quantum-resistant ZKP systems are already being
            developed to address this future threat.


            For example, projects like Starkware build faster and more secure protocols,
            ensuring they can resist quantum threats.


            ### **Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)**


            In [DAOs](https://builtin.com/blockchain/decentralized-autonomous-organization),
            members are allowed to conduct secure elections while maintaining the
            integrity of the results.


            ### **Regulatory Compliance (AML/KYC)**


            Regulatory rules like Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer
            (KYC) require businesses to share customer data to stop fraud; ZKPs simplify
            this. A  company can use them to prove it followed the rules, for example,
            verifying a user’s age without handing over sensitive details like birth
            dates or addresses. This reduces data leaks and speeds up compliance.


            Developers are working hard to make ZKPs faster and less power-hungry.
            More importantly**,**as ZKP technology improves and becomes easier to
            use, it will drive blockchain adoption in decentralized finance(DeFI)
            and supply chains.


            ZKPs are not a replacement for blockchain cryptography but rather a complementary
            technology. Together, they create a trustless system where:


            - Transactions are secure through cryptography.

            - Data is private through ZKPs.

            - Networks maintain decentralization.

            Top Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Proof Crypto Projects of 2025


            # Top Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Proof Crypto Projects of 2025


            Intermediate


            Last Update April 1, 2025


            ![Top Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Proof Crypto Projects of 2025](https://assets.staticimg.com/reaper-image/663ca291b16963000196221a_Top%20Zero-Knowledge%20%28ZK%29%20Proof%20Crypto%20Projects%20of%202024-16-9.jpg)


            Zero-knowledge proofs are cryptographic methods that enable one party
            to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any information
            beyond the validity of the statement itself. Here’s a look at some of
            the best zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) crypto projects in the market.


            Imagine being able to prove you know a secret without ever having to reveal
            it. This is the essence of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), a revolutionary
            concept in the blockchain and crypto landscape that enhances privacy and
            scalability. As we delve deeper into 2024, ZKPs are increasingly crucial
            due to their ability to execute transactions or prove knowledge without
            exposing any underlying data.


            Zero-knowledge proofs have been gaining traction for their role in addressing
            the dual challenges of privacy and scalability in blockchain technologies.
            They are particularly significant in an era where digital privacy concerns
            are peaking, and the demand for efficient, scalable blockchain solutions
            is critical. Their growing application across various crypto projects
            in 2024 underlines their potential to reshape the blockchain ecosystem.


            ## What Are Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)?


            Zero-knowledge proofs allow a "prover" to convince a "verifier" that they
            know a value or that a statement is true without revealing any information
            beyond the statement''s validity. This process hinges on three critical
            properties:


            - **Completeness:** If the prover''s statement is true, the verifier will
            be convinced by the proof without any doubt.


            - **Soundness:** If the statement is false, no cheating prover can convince
            the verifier of its truthfulness, except with negligible probability.


            - **Zero-Knowledge:** The verifier learns nothing other than the fact
            that the statement is true, gaining no further information from the proof.



            The benefits of using ZKPs in cryptocurrency projects are manifold. They
            enhance privacy by enabling transactions where no sensitive information
            is disclosed. For example, in voting systems, they can confirm a user''s
            eligibility without revealing their identity. They also improve scalability
            through constructions like [zk-Rollups](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/crypto/top-ethereum-zk-rollup-projects),
            where transaction data is processed off-chain and only the validity proof
            is stored on the blockchain, thereby reducing the data load and speeding
            up transaction times.


            Consider the often-cited "Ali Baba cave" analogy for a more interactive
            understanding. Here, a person proves they know the secret to opening a
            hidden door inside a cave without revealing the secret itself. They do
            this by performing actions that are observable (like emerging from the
            correct door), but the secret phrase itself is never disclosed.


            This concept is not just theoretical; it''s already being implemented
            in significant projects for secure transactions, identity verification,
            and more, all without compromising the privacy of any party involved.


            **Here’s a deep dive into [zero-knowledge proof (ZKP)](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/crypto/zero-knowledge-proof-zkp-explained)
            technology and how it works.**


            ## Use Cases for Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) in Blockchain


            Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are transforming how blockchain technology
            manages privacy and data integrity. Here''s how they''re being applied
            across various crypto projects and blockchain-based applications:


            1. **Financial Privacy:** ZKPs enable transactions where the validity
            of a transaction is confirmed without revealing any information about
            the transaction itself. This is crucial in cryptocurrencies like Zcash,
            where users can choose to hide transaction details such as the sender,
            recipient, and amount transferred while still maintaining a secure and
            verified ledger.


            2. **Scalable Blockchain Solutions:** Projects like zkSync and StarkWare
            utilize ZKPs to increase [blockchain scalability](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/crypto/blockchain-layer-1-vs-layer-2-scaling-solutions-explained).
            They use a technique called zk-Rollups, where transaction data is processed
            off-chain, and only the validity proofs are submitted to the blockchain.
            This drastically reduces the data load on the main chain, enabling faster
            and cheaper transactions.


            3. **Secure Voting Systems:** ZKPs can be used to ensure the integrity
            and anonymity of votes in electronic voting systems. They allow voters
            to prove their vote was counted without revealing who they voted for,
            providing privacy and transparency in the voting process.


            4. **Authentication Without Passwords:** In systems that require authentication,
            ZKPs can verify the identity of a user without the need to transmit a
            password or any other sensitive information. This method prevents attackers
            from intercepting passwords during transmission, enhancing the security
            of online platforms.


            5. **Supply Chain Traceability:** ZKPs can help verify the authenticity
            of products in a supply chain without revealing underlying trade secrets
            or confidential business information. For instance, a company could prove
            that its products meet certain environmental standards without disclosing
            its suppliers or detailed manufacturing processes.


            6. **Confidential Smart Contracts:** Platforms like [Aleph Zero](https://www.kucoin.com/price/AZERO)
            and [Mina Protocol](https://www.kucoin.com/price/MINA) are exploring the
            use of ZKPs to execute smart contracts that keep certain inputs and outputs
            private. This is particularly valuable in business contexts where contract
            details are sensitive and should not be publicly disclosed on the blockchain.



            ## Top Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) Projects of 2024


            CoinGecko has listed 40 ZK crypto projects with a combined market cap
            of over $21.27 billion as of early May 2024. Here are some of the best
            and most popular crypto projects across sectors that leverage zero-knowledge
            (ZK) proofs:


            ### Polygon Hermez


            ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/qgAASjV28kpsFqur65Lv4xiu9TJv1g1aAJIjOEjyCkgoCrxChO_gyjPwPeMV_nyEYVu6swgtyMOXXptcfORQJUI2cg4nm5AM6PaT-mlxF1KNxwqCJ_WzZVa6QQArPsjg5laXNnjNCfMfznEaMuj_j3g)


            [Polygon](https://www.kucoin.com/price/MATIC) Hermez is a decentralized
            scaling solution built on Ethereum, utilizing zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup
            technology. Originally known as Hermez Network, it was acquired by Polygon
            and rebranded to Polygon Hermez. This integration emphasizes low-cost,
            high-speed token transfers by leveraging ZK proofs to batch multiple transactions
            into single ones that are then processed on [Ethereum](https://www.kucoin.com/price/ETH),
            significantly reducing gas costs and enhancing transaction throughput.


            Polygon Hermez aims to improve scalability and efficiency for Ethereum,
            making blockchain technology more accessible and sustainable for widespread
            use. It uses a unique consensus mechanism known as Proof of Efficiency
            (PoE), designed to maintain network security and decentralization while
            being less vulnerable to the complexities and potential attacks associated
            with the earlier Proof of Donation (PoD) system. Recent advancements include
            the integration of Hermez into Polygon’s ecosystem, reflecting a strategic
            move towards enhancing Ethereum’s scalability using zero-knowledge technology.


            Key features of Polygon Hermez include substantial reductions in transaction
            costs—over 90% compared to Ethereum’s [mainnet](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/glossary/mainnet)—and
            significant throughput improvements, supporting the network''s scalability.
            However, challenges such as the complexity of ZK proofs and the need for
            specialized knowledge to implement and optimize these technologies could
            pose barriers to adoption. Looking forward, Polygon Hermez is set to continue
            evolving, focusing on enhancing its technology to better serve a growing
            user base within the Ethereum ecosystem.

            ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Mgi2FQJoUFwuclcw-mnzyuYN0hpcCBa4YyBu4B3qlzF2VQsNzGzXZ55ZseD4LCg_XgPG1uUjzkMB4QyF9f1jazmnUChcUV-mb5fMLSiw15JSVDnnS76t1VFB-pKzVXVxuUYtezqeyYTk_GJGSfdkxlg)


            Mina Protocol (MINA) stands out as a blockchain that focuses on true decentralization
            by maintaining a consistent, minimal blockchain size of only 22KB. This
            is achieved using Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of
            Knowledge (zk-SNARKs). This technique enables Mina to compress entire
            blockchain states into small snapshots, allowing any user to quickly verify
            the network''s state without needing to download a large blockchain history.
            This approach not only ensures greater accessibility but also reduces
            reliance on powerful intermediaries, thus preserving the decentralized
            nature of the blockchain.


            Mina''s mission is to streamline blockchain participation by making it
            as lightweight as possible, ensuring that anyone can verify the network
            right from their devices. This is achieved through its unique zk-SNARK
            technology, which updates with each new block, continuously compressing
            the blockchain''s history into a small proof. Mina also employs the Ouroboros
            Samisika [proof-of-stake](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos)
            [consensus mechanism](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/glossary/consensus-mechanism),
            which is less resource-intensive than traditional [proof-of-work](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/glossary/proof-of-work-pow)
            systems. Recent updates within the Mina ecosystem include advancements
            in [node](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/glossary/node) performance and
            the introduction of zkApps, which allow for [off-chain](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/glossary/off-chain)
            computation and enhanced privacy for [smart contracts](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/glossary/smart-contract).
            However, the innovative approach of using zk-SNARKs for all state transitions
            can introduce complexities in maintaining and developing on such a unique
            platform​.

            ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/_S9G2f49EaoRWqvIb3k4Sse47CLQBVSA5L_MA5UVhqnuNI9HXX1IfK1BwTg5-DM0G4C3LoExQSBUep0oxOjQfNVPXHv-YXIUOWHOHZDElRnBv-tzvSJyZF3Uw8e2q6hi2oe95Rvi4pebJVLlnKURB4c)


            [Loopring](https://www.kucoin.com/price/LRC) (LRC) is an advanced blockchain
            protocol based on Ethereum, which leverages Zero-Knowledge Rollups (zkRollups)
            to enhance the scalability and efficiency of decentralized exchanges (DEXs)
            and payment platforms. At its core, Loopring allows for the aggregation
            of hundreds of transactions into a single one, significantly reducing
            the gas costs and processing times associated with Ethereum transactions.
            The Loopring protocol achieves this by handling transactions off-chain
            and then settling them on-chain using zkRollups, which provides proof
            that transactions were executed correctly without revealing the transaction
            data itself. This method ensures both speed and security, allowing Loopring
            to process over 2,000 transactions per second​.


            The Loopring protocol also introduces a unique component called "ring
            miners," who match, verify, and settle trading orders. Miners are compensated
            for their services with fees in LRC or a split of the trading margins,
            creating an incentive for efficient order processing. Loopring''s architecture
            supports both automated market maker ( [AMM](https://www.kucoin.com/blog/what-are-automated-market-makers))
            models and traditional order book exchanges, making it versatile for various
            [trading strategies](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/trading). Despite its
            advantages, such as lower transaction costs and higher throughput, Loopring''s
            reliance on more complex technologies like zkRollups could pose a barrier
            to widespread adoption due to the technical knowledge required to implement
            and interact with such systems. Nonetheless, Loopring remains a significant
            player in the effort to scale Ethereum''s capabilities without compromising
            security.

            [Worldcoin](https://www.kucoin.com/price/WLD) (WLD) is a cryptocurrency
            project that combines digital identity verification with blockchain technology
            to provide a unique solution to global economic inclusion. The project,
            co-founded by Sam Altman, utilizes a device called an "Orb" to scan individuals''
            irises to create a secure, blockchain-based digital identity known as
            World ID. This identity is used to issue Worldcoin tokens (WLD) to individuals,
            promoting a decentralized and inclusive global economy.


            Worldcoin utilizes zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to enhance privacy andsecurity
            within its World ID system. Worldcoin employs ZKPs to confirm a user''s
            unique identity and humanity without disclosing any personal information.
            This allows for privacy-preserving interactions within the digital economy.
            Specifically, Worldcoin integrates a protocol called Semaphore, which
            uses ZKPs to enable users to prove membership in a group without revealing
            their identity. This is crucial for activities like voting or endorsements
            within the Worldcoin ecosystem, where privacy and anonymity are paramount.
            Implementing ZKPs ensures that activities carried out with a World ID
            cannot be linked to a person’s biometrics or other identity markers, safeguarding
            user privacy across different applications​.


            The project, however, has faced scrutiny and controversy, particularly
            regarding privacy and data security. The collection of biometric data
            through iris scanning has raised concerns about how this data is managed

            computations off-chain while maintaining the integrity and security typical
            of [on-chain](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/glossary/on-chain) processes.
            The core of Marlin''s architecture involves the use of coprocessors across
            a distributed network of nodes that enable high-speed data processing
            with access to both blockchain history and Web 2.0 APIs. This setup allows
            for the offloading of intensive computational tasks from the blockchain,
            reducing costs and speeding up execution time. The verification of these
            off-chain computations is ensured by combining Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)
            and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), which provide compact, secure
            verifications of computational correctness that can be easily validated
            on-chain​.

            and can execute programs written in languages like Solidity, C++, Rust,
            and Go. This flexibility is complemented by its scalable architecture,
            which includes different types of nodes, such as gateway, execution, and
            monitoring nodes, each serving a unique function within the network. Gateway
            nodes act as load balancers, execution nodes handle the actual computations,
            and monitoring nodes ensure the network''s reliability and performance.
            The Marlin ecosystem is powered by the POND token, which is used to provide
            security guarantees for the network. Nodes are required to stake POND
            tokens to participate, and they risk these stakes if they fail to adhere
            to the network''s operational standards. This staking mechanism incentivizes
            proper behavior and adherence to protocol rules.

            in the underlying cryptography to ensure the integrity and security of
            the systems.


            2. **Computational Intensity:** The generation of ZKPs can be computationally
            intensive, especially for more complex proofs. This might result in higher
            costs and slower processing times compared to non-ZKP transactions, which
            could limit the practical usability of ZKPs in high-volume scenarios.


            3. **Initial Setup Vulnerability:** Certain ZKP schemes, like zk-SNARKs,
            require a "trusted setup" phase. If this setup phase is compromised, for
            example, if the generated parameters are not destroyed, it could lead
            to significant security vulnerabilities, including the creation of counterfeit
            proofs.


            4. **Scalability Concerns:** Although ZKPs can significantly reduce the
            data load on a blockchain, the scalability of ZKP implementations themselves
            can sometimes be a challenge. The technology to efficiently handle large
            volumes of transactions without compromising on speed is still under development.


            5. **Integration Complexity:** Integrating ZKP into existing systems poses
            significant challenges. It requires changes to the network protocols and
            possibly extensive updates to existing blockchain infrastructures, which
            can be a lengthy and complex process.


            6. **Legal and Regulatory Uncertainty:** The ability of ZKPs to anonymize
            transaction data could also raise regulatory issues, particularly in jurisdictions
            with strict financial transparency laws. Projects using ZKPs must navigate
            these regulations carefully to avoid legal challenges.



            Despite these challenges, the ongoing advancements in ZKP technology and
            increasing familiarity among developers are gradually reducing these risks,
            paving the way for broader adoption of secure and private blockchain applications.


            ## Future Outlook of ZK Technologies


            The future of ZKP projects looks promising, with continuous advancements
            expected to enhance blockchain privacy and scalability. The focus will
            likely be on developing more user-friendly ZKP systems that could support
            widespread adoption across various industries. Innovations such as zk-STARKs
            and zk-SNARKs are anticipated to drive significant improvements in transaction
            speeds and scalability without compromising security or privacy.


            One of the most exciting prospects is the development of [cross-chain](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/glossary/cross-chain)
            privacy layers, which will allow secure and private transactions across
            different blockchain networks, thereby broadening the scope of blockchain
            applications and services​. These advancements could radically transform
            how sensitive data is handled across networks, making ZKPs integral to
            the development of secure digital infrastructures. As interoperability
            and cross-chain functionalities improve, ZKP projects are expected to
            play a crucial role in enabling seamless and private transactions across
            diverse blockchain systems​.


            ## Closing Thoughts


            The potential of Zero-Knowledge Proof technologies to impact the blockchain
            landscape is immense. By enabling more secure, private, and scalable blockchain
            applications, ZKPs represent a cornerstone technology for the next generation
            of blockchain innovation. As these technologies continue to evolve and
            mature, keeping an eye on the developments in this space will be crucial
            for anyone involved in blockchain and privacy technologies. Following
            projects that utilize ZKP technologies can provide insights into the future
            of digital privacy and blockchain efficiency​.

            \n## Introduction\n\nFrom finance to communications to commerce, the most\
            \ essential things in our lives are increasingly digital, and at a pace\
            \ that only continues to accelerate. This has fostered unprecedented economic\
            \ growth and technological innovations, however our most sensitive and\
            \ private information has necessarily come along for the ride. This puts\
            \ individuals, private organizations, and governments increasingly at\
            \ risk of becoming victims of data breaches and hacks.\n\nSolutions to\
            \ these problems often call for increased know your customer practices\
            \ (KYC) and reporting. KYC is a regulatory and security process where\
            \ businesses verify the identity of their clients to prevent identity\
            \ theft, financial fraud, money laundering, and terrorist financing. While\
            \ there are benefits to this approach, it comes with the risk of sensitive\
            \ data being distributed to even more parties, thus increasing the potential\
            \ surface area for attack, and further reducing individual privacy. In\
            \ a world where trust in institutions is historically low, this can be\
            \ a hard pill for individuals to swallow. But what if there was a solution\
            \ that allowed individuals, private organizations, and governments alike\
            \ to verify things like identity and financial data with said data always\
            \ remaining encrypted and obfuscated? What if you didn’t have to trust\
            \ because instead, you could verify?\n\nZero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) have\
            \ emerged as a pivotal cryptographic innovation representing a paradigm\
            \ shift replacing the need to trust with the ability to _verify_. This\
            \ comprehensive exploration will shed light on how ZKPs are reshaping\
            \ privacy and security paradigms across various sectors. By the end of\
            \ this article, policymakers will have gained a nuanced understanding\
            \ of ZKPs' potential to improve security while maintaining privacy across\
            \ a wide range of use cases and why they are indispensable in today’s\
            \ digital ecosystem.\n\n## An Idea Ahead of Its Time\n\nFirst described\
            \ in a [1985 MIT paper](https://people.csail.mit.edu/silvio/Selected%20Scientific%20Papers/Proof%20Systems/The_Knowledge_Complexity_Of_Interactive_Proof_Systems.pdf),\
            \ zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) have been an idea simmering on the back\
            \ burner of cryptographic research for decades. Although conceptually\
            \ sound, the technology required for large-scale and cost-effective deployment\
            \ was not yet available. However, with recent advancements in computational\
            \ power and the advent of blockchain technology, ZKPs are now coming to\
            \ the forefront.\n\nThe feasibility of ZKP applications now being able\
            \ to be deployed at scale can be attributed primarily to two key developments:\n\
            \n1. **Advancements in Computational Power:** Historically, ZKPs were\
            \ computationally intensive, requiring significant processing power which\
            \ limited their practicality. The exponential growth in computational\
            \ capabilities, in particular, more efficient processors and the widespread\
            \ availability of cloud computing, has made it feasible to perform complex\
            \ ZKP computations quickly and cost-effectively.\n\n2. **Synergies with\
            \ Blockchain Technology:** The cryptographic nature of ZKPs aligns seamlessly\
            \ with blockchain technologies. Blockchain's inherent characteristics\
            \ of decentralization, immutability, and transparency provide a conducive\
            \ environment for ZKP applications. Several blockchain platforms have\
            \ integrated ZKPs as a core component of their technology stack, fostering\
            \ ready-built platforms for the development and deployment of ZKP-based\
            \ applications.\n\n\nThese technological advancements have transformed\
            \ ZKPs from a theoretical concept into a practical tool, unlocking their\
            \ potential to enhance privacy and security in an increasingly digital\
            \ world.\n\n## How Do Zero-Knowledge Proofs Work?\n\nIn a zero-knowledge\
            \ proof, there are two parties: a prover and a verifier. In this transaction,\
            \ the prover can assure a verifier of the truthfulness of a particular\
            \ assertion regarding a data point without revealing any extra details\
            \ about the corresponding data.\n\nZKPs can be categorized into two types:\n\
            \n- **Interactive**, where the prover must engage in the verification\
            \ process anew for each distinct verifier.\n\n- **Non-interactiv** e,\
            \ where the prover creates a universally verifiable proof.\n\n\nThe three\
            \ key characteristics that encapsulate a ZKP are:\n\n- **Completeness**:\
            \ For any true statement, a credible prover can successfully persuade\
            \ an honest verifier of their knowledge about the accurate input.\n\n\
            - **Soundness:** In the case of a false statement, no deceitful prover\
            \ can independently convince an honest verifier of their knowledge about\
            \ the accurate input.\n\n- **Zero-Knowledge**: When the statement is true,\
            \ the verifier gains no additional information from the prover beyond\
            \ the fact that the statement is indeed true.\n\n\nThe math that makes\
            \ this possible is beyond the scope of this piece, however, a simple example\
            \ can help conceptualize how a ZKP works.\n\nImagine you have a \"Where's\
            \ Waldo?\" book, and you claim to know exactly where Waldo is on a particular\
            \ page. Your friend, however, is skeptical and wants proof of your claim.\
            \ But here's the challenge: you need to prove you know where Waldo is\
            \ without pointing him out directly, thus keeping his location a secret.\n\
            \n![A photo in sepia of a crowd with a man wearing glasses and a red and\

            \nHere's how you can do it: \"Where's Waldo?\"\n\n1. **The Challenge:**\
            \ You open the \"Where's Waldo?\" book to the page in question and show\
            \ it to your friend.\n\n2. **The Proof Technique:** To prove your knowledge\
            \ without revealing Waldo's location, you take a large piece of cardboard\
            \ with a small hole cut in it.\n\n3. **The Verification:** You place the\
            \ cardboard over the page so that the hole reveals Waldo, but nothing\
            \ else on the page is visible. Your friend can now see Waldo through the\
            \ hole, confirming you know his location.\n\n4. **Maintaining Secrecy:**\
            \ Despite verifying your claim, your friend still doesn't know where on\
            \ the page Waldo is. The rest of the page is covered, keeping the information\
            \ hidden.\n\n\nIn this scenario:\n\n- **Completeness:** If you truly know\
            \ where Waldo is, you can easily align the hole in the cardboard to reveal\
            \ him, convincing your friend of your knowledge.\n\n- **Soundness:** If\
            \ you don’t actually know where Waldo is, you won’t be able to align the\
            \ hole correctly, and your friend won’t be convinced of your claim.\n\n\
            - **Zero-Knowledge:** Despite proving you know Waldo’s location, you haven’t\
            \ revealed any additional information about where on the page Waldo is.\n\
            \n\nThese proofs enable one party to prove the validity of a statement\
            \ to another without revealing any underlying information. In an era where\
            \ data breaches are rampant, ZKPs offer hope for secure and private online\
            \ interactions.\n\n## A Myriad of Real-World and Digital-World Applications\n\
            \nZKPs have a wide array of applications, each demonstrating their versatility\
            \ and importance in enhancing privacy and security in various digital\
            \ domains:\n\n### Decentralized Identity and Authentication:\n\nZKPs can\
            \ serve as a foundational technology for identity management systems by\
            \ offering a dual advantage: they enable robust identity verification\
            \ while safeguarding personal information. This is particularly relevant\
            \ in systems built on blockchains, which are inherently global and interoperable,\
            \ facilitating secure international information sharing.\n\n- **Offline\
            \ Applications:** ZKPs can be used in everyday situations like confirming\
            \ age for alcohol purchase or even verifying citizenship and non-sanctioned\
            \ status at international borders. In these cases, ZKPs provide proof\
            \ of specific personal attributes without revealing any additional personal\
            \ information.\n\n- **Online Applications:** The decentralized nature\
            \ of blockchain networks limits traditional KYC practices, but ZKPs offer\
            \ a way for central entities to securely verify user identities.\n\n\n\
            Since it is one of the most impactful applications of ZKPs, the following\
            \ section takes a deep dive into decentralized identity.\n\n### Voting\
            \ Systems:\n\nZKPs introduce a new paradigm in voting systems, particularly\
            \ in conjunction with distributed ledger technologies. Together, they\
            \ enable a voting process that is both anonymous and verifiable, enhancing\
            \ the integrity and transparency of elections.\n\n- **Identity Verification\
            \ and Eligibility Checks:** Leveraging the decentralized identity solutions\
            \ discussed earlier, ZKPs can be used to verify a voter's identity and\
            \ their eligibility to vote. This approach ensures that only qualified\
            \ individuals participate in the voting process and that no one can vote\
            \ more than once. Such identity verification acts as a gatekeeper to access\
            \ existing voting systems, upholding the principle that every vote counts\
            \ and should be counted correctly.\n\n- **Anonymous Verifiable Voting:**\
            \ Beyond verifying voter identity, ZKPs can preserve the anonymity of\
            \ the voting process. Voters can confidently validate their eligibility\
            \ and cast their ballots without having to reveal their identities or\
            \ the specifics of their vote. This application of ZKPs allows each vote\
            \ to remain confidential while ensuring the entire voting process is transparent\
            \ and auditable.\n\n- **Auditable Yet Private Voting System:** The integration\
            \ of ZKPs in voting systems is transformative, enhancing both the verification\
            \ mechanism and the voting process itself. By incorporating ZKPs, the\
            \ system not only links each vote to an eligible voter but also maintains\
            \ voter anonymity. This dual capability creates a voting environment that\
            \ is secure, transparent, and respectful of voter privacy. The system\
            \ can be implemented either as an identity check before accessing existing\
            \ voting platforms or as an integral part of a new blockchain-based voting\
            \ system, embedding both identity verification and vote casting within\
            \ a unified, secure framework.\n\n\n### AI and Machine Learning:\n\n-\
            \ Privacy Preservation in Data Usage:\n  - A key challenge in AI and machine\
            \ learning is accessing large datasets for training models without compromising\
            \ sensitive information contained within the data. ZKPs enable the verification\
            \ of data authenticity and integrity for these models while keeping the\
            \ underlying data elements private.\n\n  - The capability to verify information\
            \ while maintain privacy is particularly crucial in industries like healthcare\
            \ or finance, where data confidentiality is paramount. ZKPs allow for\
            \ the utilization of detailed datasets for model training without exposing\
            \ individual data points, thus upholding privacy standards and regulatory\
            \ compliance.\n- Blockchain Integration for Model Accountability:\n  -\
            \ Combining ZKPs with blockchain technology introduces a new level of\
            \ transparency and accountability in AI and machine learning. Blockchain\
            \ provides an immutable record of transactions which enables the tracking\
            \ of data changes, model updates, and decision-making processes when applied\
            \ to AI models.\n\n  - This integration allows for a transparent audit\
            \ trail of how AI models evolve over time and how data influences these\
            \ models. It addresses concerns around model integrity and reliability,\
            \ ensuring that changes or updates to AI systems are transparent and accountable.\n\
            - Enhancing Trust in AI Systems:\n  - By utilizing ZKPs, AI and machine\
            \ learning systems can demonstrate that they function as intended without\
            \ revealing their internal workings or the proprietary data they process.\
            \ This builds trust among users and stakeholders, assuring them that the\
            \ AI systems are not only effective but also respect privacy and data\
            \ security.\n\n  - In scenarios where decisions made by AI systems need\
            \ to be justified or explained, such as in credit scoring or medical diagnostics,\
            \ the combination of ZKPs and blockchain can provide necessary assurances\
            \ about the data and processes used without compromising sensitive information.\n\
            - Facilitating Collaborative AI Development:\n  - ZKPs enable multiple\
            \ parties to contribute data to AI models securely and privately. This\
            \ collaborative approach, bolstered by the trust mechanisms of ZKPs and\
            \ blockchain, can accelerate AI innovation by allowing diverse data sources\
            \ to be used collectively, broadening the scope and applicability of AI\
            \ solutions.\n\n### Privacy on Public Blockchains:\n\n- The immutable\
            \ and public nature of data stored on a blockchain is a defining and often\
            \ beneficial feature, this feature can become an issue in transactions\
            \ that require privacy. For more on the challenges and opportunities presented\
            \ by the transparent nature of public blockchains, check out our previous\
            \ [Blockchain Brief on blockchain privacy.](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/blockchain-worlds-least-private-diary)\n\
            \  - **Private Transactions:** ZKPs are used in blockchains for privacy-preserving\
            \ transactions that keep details like monetary amounts and participant\
            \ identities private.  ZKPs can keep this information private while verifying\
            \ that users are not participating in illicit activity or transacting\
            \ with sanctioned entities.\n\n  - **Private Exchange and Settlement of\
            \ Digital Assets:** ZKPs ensure the privacy of transactions and participants\
            \ during the exchange of digital tokens, such as equity tokens. This is\
            \ crucial for both centralized and decentralized exchanges, allowing for\
            \ efficient and private asset settlement. As more real-world assets (RWAs)\
            \ like real estate and high-valuable collectibles are tokenized and more\
            \ transactions involving RWAs are conducted on-chain, this efficiency\
            \ and privacy is paramount.\n\n### Scalable Ethereum Layer 2 Rollups:\n\
            \nZKPs, through methods like zero-knowledge rollups (ZK-rollups), are\
            \ highly secure and scalable Layer 2 solutions on Ethereum that facilitate\
            \ faster, more efficient transactions. If you need a refresher on the\
            \ difference between a Layer 1 and Layer 2 blockchain before we dive deeper\
            \ into the current state of ZK rollups, be sure to check out our previous\
            \ [Blockchain Brief where we break it down.](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/understanding-ethereums-layer-1-and-layer-2-differences-adoption-and-drawbacks)\n\
            \n### Oracle-Enhanced Verifiable Computations:\n\n- In decentralized oracle\
            \ networks, ZKPs can be leveraged for verifiable computations related\
            \ to off-chain data points. [As explained in a previous Blockchain Brief](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/delphi-defi-how-crypto-oracles-are-shaping-future-finance),\
            \ blockchain oracles provide smart contracts with access to external data\
            \ and computation results. Using ZKPs in this context ensures the integrity\
            \ and confidentiality of the data processed by the oracles. Relevant off-chain\
            \ data points include:Financial Data: Verifying stock prices or foreign\
            \ exchange rates for use in smart contracts without revealing sensitive\
            \ market data.\n\n- Supply Chain Information: Confirming the authenticity\
            \ of supply chain events like product manufacturing or shipping status\
            \ without disclosing proprietary details.\n\n- Real-World Events: Maintaining\
            \ data privacy while validating outcomes of real-world events, like sports\
            \ results and election outcomes, that impact contract executions Weather\
            \ Data: Securely integrating weather information for agriculture-related\
            \ smart contracts without full data exposure.\n\n\n### Internet of Things\
            \ (IoT):\n\n- Securing IoT device communications and reducing data transmission\
            \ through ZKPs enhances both privacy and efficiency in interconnected\
            \ devices.\n\n\n### Supply Chains:\n\n- ZKPs can authenticate compliance\
            \ and origin in supply chain management without revealing sensitive data,\
            \ which is crucial for businesses that wish to keep supplier information\
            \ confidential.\n\n\nThese diverse applications across sectors underscores\
            \ the significance of ZKPs in addressing privacy and security challenges\
            \ in the digital age by offering robust solutions for secure, private,\
            \ and efficient digital interactions.\n\n## A Deeper Dive into Decentralized\
            \ Digital Identity and Securing Personal Identifiable Information\n\n\
            Zero-knowledge proofs present a unique solution to address the urgent\
            \ need for safe and secure methods of digital identity verification and\
            \ storage of personal identifiable information (PII). ZPKs minimize the\
            \ exposure of PII by enabling the verification of essential information\
            \ while keeping other personal details hidden, thereby fortifying systems\
            \ against data breaches and preserving individual privacy. This is crucial\
            \ in scenarios ranging from social media interactions to financial transactions.\n\
            \nConsider the routine action of showing an ID to purchase alcohol – you\
            \ inadvertently expose more information than necessary.\n\nThe cashier\
            \ only needs to verify two things: that the id is a valid, government\
            \ issued id and that you are 21 or older. Yet you are revealing your full\
            \ name, home address, birthdate and age, sex, height, weight, eye color,\
            \ and driver’s license number. These pieces of information are individually\
            \ harmless, but when they are used together, there is potential for abuse,\
            \ not to mention a violation of an individual’s right to privacy.\n\n\
            This scenario is amplified online, where the sharing of social security\
            \ numbers, financial details, and personal activities often leads to privacy\
            \ invasion and increases the risk of cyberattacks. Consider the following\
            \ three examples representing massive misuse and exposure of sensitive\
            \ user data, and how Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) could have potentially\
            \ mitigated these incidents:\n\n1\\. Cambridge Analytica Scandal:\n\n\
            - **Real-World Incident:** A third-party app, This Is Your Digital Life,\
            \ allowed unauthorized collection of personal data from millions of Facebook\
            \ users. Cambridge Analytica used that data for political advertising,\
            \ including in the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign. This breach\
            \ raised significant concerns about privacy and the influence of social\
            \ media on politics.\n\n- **ZKP Mitigation:** ZKPs could have been used\
            \ to verify the specific user attributes (e.g., age, location, political\
            \ interests) necessary for academic research or targeted advertising without\
            \ revealing or transferring the underlying data. That way, Facebook could\
            \ confirm specific demographics of its user base to third parties without\
            \ exposing individual user data.\n\n\n2\\.  T-Mobile Data Breaches:\n\n\
            - **Real-World Incident:** Caused by a misconfigured API, T-Mobile experienced\
            \ a data breach that exposed the personal data of 37 million customers.\
            \ The stolen data was used by cybercriminals for sophisticated phishing,\
            \ vishing, and smishing attacks.\n\n- **ZKP Mitigation:** ZKPs could have\
            \ been employed in T-Mobile’s data handling processes to validate user\
            \ identity and credentials without exposing user data. For instance, a\
            \ customer service application could verify that a person is a T-Mobile\
            \ customer and check their plan details without the API accessing the\
            \ full range of personal information stored in the database.\n\n\n3\\\
            . Equifax Data Breach of 2017:\n\n- **Real-World Incident:** This breach,\
            \ one of the largest in U.S. history, compromised the personal information\
            \ of about 147.9 million Americans, as well as millions of British and\
            \ Canadian citizens. Hackers accessed names, Social Security numbers,\
            \ birth dates, addresses, and in some cases, driver's license numbers.\
            \ The breach was deemed \"entirely preventable\" by the House Committee\
            \ on Oversight.\n\n- **ZKP Mitigation:** If ZKPs had been used, Equifax\
            \ could have allowed third-party services to confirm individuals' creditworthiness\
            \ or identity without accessing detailed personal data like Social Security\
            \ numbers or birth dates. For example, a lender could verify if a person's\
            \ credit score falls within a specific range without Equifax needing to\
            \ share the actual credit report.\n\n\nIn each of these scenarios, ZKPs\
            \ would have offered a way to validate and prove necessary information\
            \ without exposing data, thus significantly reducing the risk of data\
            \ breaches and misuse of personal information. Implementing ZKPs requires\
            \ rethinking how systems interact with personal data and moving towards\
            \ a model where verification is possible without data exposure. The adoption\
            \ of ZKPs benefits individuals whose personal data remains protected and\
            \ private as well as businesses, which can avoid the substantial financial\
            \ and reputational damage often associated with such data breaches. By\
            \ enhancing data security and integrity, ZKPs provide two key benefits:\
            \ they help in building trust among consumers and simultaneously safeguard\
            \ businesses against the risks and liabilities of data mismanagement.\n\
            \n## The Current State of ZK-Rollups\n\nAs noted earlier, the two developments\
            \ that have allowed ZKPs to finally transition from academic concept to\
            \ real world use have been increased power and availability of compute\
            \ and blockchains. While smart contract platforms like Solana and Avalanche\
            \ have seen significant growth in daily active users, ecosystem development,\
            \ and capital inflows in 2023, Ethereum and its Layer 2 blockchains remain\
            \ the dominant smart contract ecosystem. As of 1/17/24, Ethereum and its\
            \ L2 chains have a combined market cap ($322B) 1.6X higher than [every\
            \ other smart contract platform combined](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/smart-contract-platform)\
            \ and 72% ($78B) of [total value locked](https://defillama.com/chains)\
            \ (TVL) in [decentralized finance (DeFi)](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/defi-101-good-bad-and-regulatory).\n\
            \nAs discussed in our previous article, breaking down the difference between\
            \ [L1 and L2 Ethereum](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/understanding-ethereums-layer-1-and-layer-2-differences-adoption-and-drawbacks),\
            \ L2 blockchains are pivotal in enabling Ethereum to scale. As a quick\
            \ refresher, there are two types of rollups: Optimistic rollups and ZK\
            \ rollups. While ZK rollups are broadly considered the superior technology,\
            \ the increased complexity of ZKP development, higher compute requirements,\
            \ and layer 1 technological limitations have given optimistic rollups\
            \ a strong first mover advantage. The top three optimistic rollups, [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.foundation/),\
            \ [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/), and [Base](https://www.base.org/),\
            \ currently hold 81% of the total L2 market share.\n\nThe tide has begun\
            \ to change, as several notable ZK-rollups went live in 2023. As of 2024,\
            \ the development and implementation of ZK-rollups on Ethereum have advanced\
            \ significantly, showing promising growth and innovation in various projects.\n\
            \nYou can find a list of notable Optimistic and ZK-rollups in the previous\
            \ Blockchain Brief, [Understanding Ethereum's Layer 1 and Layer 2](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/understanding-ethereums-layer-1-and-layer-2-differences-adoption-and-drawbacks).\n\
            \nWhile optimistic rollups collectively represent the majority of L2 activity\
            \ and TVL, ZK-rollups are quickly picking up steam and are expected to\
            \ overtake their optimistic cousins. Notably, over the last 30 days, [zkSync\
            \ Era](https://zksync.io/) has processed more transactions than Arbitrum,\
            \ Optimism, Base, and Ethereum Mainnet. Both Arbitrum and Optimism have\
            \ both stated they expect to transition their respective chains to ZK-rollups\
            \ eventually.\n\nThe key takeaway here is that the myriad of real-world\
            \ use cases enabled by ZKPs requires a compatible blockchain. That compatibility\
            \ now exists with the advent of ZK-rollups. This, in conjunction with\
            \ the upcoming [Dencun upgrade](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/10/27/ethereums-dencun-upgrade-is-a-step-toward-a-scalable-settlement-layer-goldman-sachs/)\
            \ to Ethereum set to launch in the coming months (currently live on testnet\
            \ as of 1/17/24), which will dramatically decrease transaction costs for\
            \ L2s while bringing enhanced security, will not only allow all of these\
            \ use cases to deploy but also allow them to do so cost-effectively at\
            \ scale.\n\n## Why Policymakers Should Pay Attention\n\nWe live in an\
            \ increasingly digital world. As individuals, private organizations, and\
            \ governments move more of their interactions online, ever more of our\
            \ most sensitive data is put at risk of data breaches and hacks. At a\
            \ time when faith in public institutions is at an [all time low](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/09/19/public-trust-in-government-1958-2023/)\
            \ and global ransomware attacks are predicted to [exceed $265B by 2031](https://cybersecurityventures.com/global-ransomware-damage-costs-predicted-to-reach-250-billion-usd-by-2031/),\
            \ the need for technologies like ZKPs to restore faith in the integrity\
            \ of elections, bolster online security, and protect an individual's right\
            \ to privacy is abundantly clear.\n\nThere are many applications of ZKPs\
            \ that can help balance privacy, security, and regulatory compliance.\
            \ This is especially relevant in the context of global and interoperable\
            \ blockchain technology, where ZKPs can bolster blockchains ability to\
            \ enhance the resilience and accessibility of critical infrastructure\
            \ and international cooperation.\n\n### Challenges in the US Regulatory\
            \ Environment\n\nThe US’s ambiguous regulatory environment is currently\
            \ driving blockchain and ZKP-based technology development overseas. A\
            \ lack of clear guidelines is causing a brain drain in this sector, with\
            \ developers and companies opting for more predictable and supportive\
            \ environments in countries like Japan, Singapore, and parts of the EU.\
            \ This regulatory uncertainty is particularly impactful in the area of\
            \ decentralized finance (DeFi), where traditional frameworks struggle\
            \ to adapt to the novel nature of blockchain technologies.\n\n### ZKPs:\
            \ A Potential Solution to DeFi KYC\n\nWithin this challenging regulatory\
            \ landscape, the proposed digital assets tax reporting regulations in\
            \ the bipartisan infrastructure bill have defined decentralized entities\
            \ as brokers. This definition is incompatible with the decentralized nature\
            \ of these entities' protocols, as many lack a central entity capable\
            \ of conducting traditional Know Your Customer (KYC) practices. The significant\
            \ compliance and cost burden for startups could drive talent offshore,\
            \ potentially cutting off US users from innovative products. Furthermore,\
            \ the decentralized structure of these platforms allows users bypass front-end\
            \ data collection and access the backend directly.\n\nZero-Knowledge Proofs\
            \ (ZKPs) emerge as a feasible solution in this context. They enable the\
            \ verification of essential information and reporting through smart contracts,\
            \ all without the need to store sensitive data. By using ZKPs, compliance\
            \ with regulations can be achieved while maintaining a balance between\
            \ privacy, security, and innovation. This technology not only minimizes\
            \ the risk of spreading sensitive data across multiple parties but also\
            \ alleviates the compliance burden for emerging companies. In turn, this\
            \ fosters a healthier environment for technological advancement in the\
            \ US, particularly in the burgeoning field of DeFi.\n\n## Conclusion:\
            \ A Call to Action for Policymakers\n\nAs we navigate the complexities\
            \ of the digital age, Zero-Knowledge Proofs emerge as a powerful tool\
            \ in preserving privacy while ensuring security. Policymakers face the\
            \ challenge of fostering an environment that supports the growth and application\
            \ of ZKPs while protecting consumer rights and privacy. Regulations should\
            \ be forward-thinking, adaptable, and balanced to encourage innovation\
            \ in this space. The harmonious blend of privacy and security that ZKPs\
            \ provide is not just a technological advancement but a step towards a\
            \ more secure and equitable digital world.\n\nIn conclusion, the potential\
            \ of ZKPs is vast and multifaceted. From securing online transactions\
            \ to safeguarding AI and machine learning models, they offer a solution\
            \ that strikes a balance between privacy and security. As machine learning\
            \ continues to evolve and our digital footprints expand, the role of ZKPs\
            \ in protecting our digital identities is critical. It is imperative for\
            \ policymakers to understand these dynamics and create a regulatory environment\
            \ that nurtures innovation, protects consumers, and maintains the integrity\
            \ of the financial system. By embracing the possibilities of Zero-Knowledge\
            \ Proofs, we can pave the way for a more secure, private, and equitable\
            \ digital future.\n\n- [Science and Technology](https://5g.wilsoncenter.org/issue/science-and-technology)\n\

            **Unlocking the Potential of Zero-Knowledge Proofs in Blockchain**


            [https://bit.ly/4cqxJvR](https://bit.ly/4cqxJvR)


            **January 26, 2024**


            Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are becoming a standard within blockchain
            technology, helping to maintain transactional privacy and integrity, highlighting
            their potential to create a more secure and [private blockchain landscape](https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/258601-blockchain-for-what-exactly/fulltext).


            In this post, we will explore the intricate world of zero-knowledge proofs
            (ZKPs) and their role within the blockchain. The focus will be on the
            theoretical underpinnings and potential applications of ZKPs, examining
            how they could revolutionize privacy in blockchain transactions.


            Additionally, the piece will critically assess the current state of ZKP
            technology, exploring its benefits and limitations, and discussing its
            future possibilities for enhancing blockchain security and privacy.


            ## What is a Zero-Knowledge Proof?


            A zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is a cryptographic method that is used to
            prove an individual knows a set of data, without revealing what this data
            contains. This form of verification can be extremely effective in scenarios
            where the details of data need to remain private.


            Blockchains are designed to be transparent, but there are many situations
            where privacy is required. For example, smart contracts may contain sensitive
            information such as financial details or personally identifiable information
            that could be used to commit fraud or other criminal activity. To protect
            this information, smart contracts often require specific inputs before
            they can be executed.


            Zero-knowledge proofs have established themselves as one of the primary
            methods to accomplish privacy on a public blockchain. This is achieved
            by one party (the prover) cryptographically proving to another party (the
            verifier) that they possess accurate knowledge of hidden data – data that
            could only be known by the prover with a very high level of certainty.


            In addition to more private blockchain transactions, ZKPs can also help
            [thwart cybercriminals](https://cacm.acm.org/news/262123-darpa-report-finds-vulnerabilities-in-blockchain-tech-non-secure-crypto-transactions/fulltext)
            by adding a layer of security. The importance of such technology is even
            more evident when you consider that [66% of organizations](https://bluetree.ai/cybersecurity-market-growth/)
            have experienced a cyber attack in the past 12 months. This just so happened
            to create the perfect storm, sparking curiosity and bringing the blockchain
            to the limelight once again.


            ## How ZKPs Work


            An advanced-level zero-knowledge proof requires the prover to perform
            several actions that verify the underlying data is known if executed properly.
            In the event of an individual attempting to gain unauthorized access to
            the data, i.e., guessing at the required actions, the verifier’s testing
            procedures will determine that the attempt at providing proof is not legitimate.


            ZKPs can come in two forms, interactive or non-interactive. An interactive
            ZKP requires the prover to repeat the process for individual verifiers
            each time. Meanwhile, a non-interactive ZKP allows the prover to generate
            proof that can be verified by anyone who has knowledge of the same proof.


            The concept of zero-knowledge proofs was initially outlined in the 1985
            MIT paper “ [The Knowledge Complexity of Interactive Proof-Systems](https://people.csail.mit.edu/silvio/Selected%20Scientific%20Papers/Proof%20Systems/The_Knowledge_Complexity_Of_Interactive_Proof_Systems.pdf),”
            which was written by Shafi Goldwasser and Silvio Micali. The paper outlined
            how it was possible to provide a distinct statement about a data point,
            which could be verified as true, without the need to provide additional
            details.


            Three key characteristics help to define ZKPs:


            - Completeness – If the information or statement provided, and the actions
            taken are correct, then the verifier can determine that the prover possesses
            sufficient knowledge.


            - Soundness – If the information provided is false and the prover is attempting
            to gain unauthorized access then the verifier can easily determine that
            the prover does not know the correct input.


            - Zero-knowledge – In this case, the prover can provide a true statement,
            however, this does not provide the verifier with any additional information
            regarding the correct input.



            ## Types of Zero-Knowledge Proofs


            Zero-knowledge proofs can come in various forms, each having different
            characteristics in terms of proof times, verification times, the size
            of the proof, etc. The most popular ZKPs include:


            1. PLONK – An acronym of “permutations over Lagrange-bases for oecumenical
            non-interactive arguments of knowledge.” PLONK is regarded as one of the
            most trusted and ubiquitous ZKP setups and is compatible with any program,
            while also able to include a large number of participants.


            2. ZK-SNARKS – A “succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge” is small-scale
            and simple to verify. This type of ZKP generates cryptographic proof using
            elliptical curves and requires less computational resources compared to
            a hashing function.


            3. ZK-STARKS – A “scalable transparent argument of knowledge” is a ZKP
            that involves a low level of interaction between the prover and the verifier,
            resulting in a faster speed.


            4. Bulletproofs – This type is a short non-interactive zero-knowledge
            proof that does not need a trusted setup and is suitable for private transactions
            for cryptocurrencies.



            ## Advantages


            A key benefit of ZKPs is their effectiveness when it comes to leveraging
            privacy-preserving datasets within public blockchains or other systems
            that are designed for maximum transparency. This is particularly useful
            for the execution of [smart contracts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-contracts.asp#:~:text=%25%2025%25%200%25-,What%20Is%20a%20Smart%20Contract%3F,transactions%20are%20trackable%20and%20irreversible.).


            Smart contracts are self-executing programs that automatically perform
            actions that are defined in an agreement between two parties. Once the
            actions have been completed, transactions can be tracked and can’t be
            reversed, enabling visibility. With zero-knowledge proof, users and businesses
            can execute smart contracts on the blockchain, while keeping the stored
            data private.


            ## Benefits for Institutions


            This is essential for institutions such as banks, financial institutions,
            enterprise-level businesses, and businesses that are part of a wider supply
            chain and must adhere to strict confidentiality when executing smart contracts.
            Such organizations are also legally required to safeguard the Personally
            Identifiable Information (PII) of their clients and comply with regulations
            set out by the countries they operate in.


            ZKPs allow institutions to interact with public blockchain networks that
            have large volumes of users around the world, while still keeping datasets
            private. Without ZKPs, regulated businesses and institutions would need
            to rely on permitted blockchain networks that have far fewer users than
            public blockchain networks.


            This is why ZKP technology is being applied to many institutional use
            cases for public blockchains, resulting in increased accessibility, more
            efficient economies, and innovations. Even institutions like the [London
            Stock Exchange have entered the market](https://tokenist.com/london-stock-exchange-group-to-launch-blockchain-powered-trading-platform/),
            responsible for handling huge volumes of financial data, and are exploring
            the possibility of not just tokenization, but using ZKP to bolster their
            defenses.


            ## Use Cases


            From cybersecurity to Web3 projects, ZPKs have a wide range of use cases.
            Following are three common uses for which the technology is becoming a
            standard.


            - Private Transactions – An example of a private transaction is one made
            on the [Zcash](https://z.cash/) blockchain, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency.
            By using ZKPs, transactions remain completely private and details such
            as the sender, receiver, and monetary value are not disclosed.


            - Decentralized Identity/ Authentication – ZKPs can play a fundamental
            role in identity management systems that allow users to verify their identity
            while protecting their details.


            - Verifiable Computations – A decentralized oracle network offers smart
            contracts that can access off-chain data and computations that can be
            combined with ZKPs. In this case, the prover can provide a statement about
            an off-chain data point without revealing any data.



            ## Limitations and Future Developments


            The main limitation regarding ZKPs is the hardware, as the technology
            requires graphic processing units (GPUs) that have parallel processing
            capability to reduce the resources and time needed to prove a statement.


            Meanwhile, PLONK uses improved algorithms to provide faster and more effective
            solutions, with similar alternatives expected to be developed in the future.
            However, more abstraction layers also must be developed to complement
            such advancements if the technology is to witness widespread adoption.
            Although the [development landscape](https://cacm.acm.org/news/253536-developers-are-fans-of-blockchain-but-most-have-not-used-it-much-at-work/fulltext)
            is active for ZKPs, the complexity of the technology still provides significant
            challenges.


            From a business standpoint, the implementation of ZKPs and other blockchain
            security technologies has presented some hurdles. With the [increased
            integration of blockchain](https://cacm.acm.org/news/226052-demand-for-blockchain-experts-surges-amid-skills-shortage/fulltext)
            to business platforms, even smaller organizations are [looking for help
            with SAP S4 HANA](https://www.suretysystems.com/insights/how-can-s4-hana-consulting-sap-services-improve-system-efficiency/),
            given the fact that the German giant already [included blockchain into
            its products](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_HANA_BLOCKCHAIN_ADAPTER/c5bee9180afc4a4e93a0742bb352db11/3d17b9c2c38841cd8c56c91342aee048.html)
            for both security and efficiency reasons.


            Fortunately, the infrastructure that powers cryptocurrency is expected
            to evolve rapidly due to the technology’s popularity, causing optimism
            in ZKP circles. There is a significant investment in both consumer-facing
            cryptocurrency platforms and their backend infrastructure, with ZKPs a
            key consideration for creating a decentralized, privacy-first web.


            ## Conclusion


            Zero-knowledge proofs are a rapidly growing technology that is used to
            ensure transactional privacy and integrity on the blockchain. This is
            key to allowing institutions such as banks, that must adhere to strict
            regulations, to interact with and execute smart contracts on public blockchain
            networks.


            Although ZKPs still face barriers in terms of hardware and their complexity
            from a development point-of-view, the technology is expected to evolve
            significantly, boosted by major investment in cryptocurrencies and their
            infrastructure.
