            \ of AI with blockchain technology opens up new possibilities for the\
            \ real estate sector. Blockchain is a distributed database where information\
            \ is stored in immutable \"blocks.\" It ensures transaction security and\
            \ data transparency while AI analyzes these data points to derive actionable\
            \ insights. In practice, this means that ownership histories, all transactions,\
            \ and property modifications are recorded in an unalterable format, with\
            \ AI aiding in interpreting these records and informing decision-making\
            \ processes.\n\n## The Future of AI in Real Estate: Trends and Forecasts\n\

            \ New Heights\n\n![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nGracjan Prusik\n\n11 Mar\
            \ 2025\n\n![AI-Driven Frontend Automation: Elevating Developer Productivity\
            \ to New Heights](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\n* * *\n\n## AI Revolution\
            \ in the Frontend Developer's Workshop\n\nIn today's world, programming\
            \ without AI support means giving up a powerful tool that radically increases\
            \ a developer's productivity and efficiency. For the modern developer,\
            \ AI in frontend automation is not just a curiosity, but a key tool that\
            \ enhances productivity. From automatically generating components, to\
            \ refactoring, and testing – AI tools are fundamentally changing our daily\
            \ work, allowing us to focus on the creative aspects of programming instead\
            \ of the tedious task of writing repetitive code. In this article, I will\
            \ show how these tools are most commonly used to work faster, smarter,\
            \ and with greater satisfaction.\n\nThis post kicks off a **series dedicated\
            \ to the use of AI in frontend automation**, where we will analyze and\
            \ discuss **specific tools, techniques, and practical use cases of AI**\
            \ that help developers in their everyday tasks.\n\n## AI in Frontend Automation\
            \ – How It Helps with Code Refactoring\n\nOne of the most common uses\
            \ of AI is improving code quality and finding errors. These tools can\
            \ analyze code and suggest optimizations. As a result, we will be able\
            \ to write code much faster and significantly reduce the risk of human\
            \ error.\n\n**How AI Saves Us from Frustrating Bugs**\n\nImagine this\
            \ situation: you spend hours debugging an application, not understanding\
            \ why data isn't being fetched. Everything seems correct, the syntax is\
            \ fine, yet something isn't working. Often, the problem lies in small\
            \ details that are hard to catch when reviewing the code.\n\nLet’s take\
            \ a look at an example:\n\n``` line-numbers\nfunction fetchData() {\n\
            \    fetch(\"htts://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts\")\n      .then((response)\
            \ => response.json())\n      .then((data) => console.log(data))\n    \
            \  .catch((error) => console.error(error));\n}\n```\n\nAt first glance,\
            \ the code looks correct. However, upon running it, no data is retrieved.\
            \ Why? There’s a typo in the URL – \"htts\" instead of \"https.\" This\
            \ is a classic example of an error that could cost a developer hours of\
            \ frustrating debugging.\n\nWhen we ask AI to refactor this code, not\
            \ only will we receive a more readable version using newer patterns (async/await),\
            \ but also – and most importantly – AI will automatically detect and fix\

            ## How AI in Frontend Automation Speeds Up UI Creation\n\n**One of the\
            \ most obvious applications of AI in frontend development is generating\
            \ UI components.** Tools like [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot),\
            \ [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/), or [Claude](https://claude.ai/) can\
            \ generate component code based on a short description or an image provided\
            \ to them.\n\nWith these tools, we can create complex user interfaces\
            \ in just a few seconds. Generating a complete, functional UI component\
            \ often takes less than a minute. Furthermore, the generated code is typically\
            \ error-free, includes appropriate animations, and is fully responsive,\
            \ adapting to different screen sizes. It is important to describe exactly\
            \ what we expect.\n\nHere’s a view generated by [Claude](https://claude.ai/)\
            \ after entering the request: “Based on the loaded data, display posts.\
            \ The page should be responsive. The main colors are: #CCFF89, #151515,\
            \ and #E4E4E4.”\n\n![Generated posts view](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\n\
            ## AI in Code Analysis and Understanding\n\nAI can analyze existing code\
            \ and help understand it, which is particularly useful in large, complex\
            \ projects or code written by someone else.\n\n**Example: Generating a\
            \ summary of a function's behavior**\n\nLet’s assume we have a function\
            \ for processing user data, the workings of which we don’t understand\
            \ at first glance. AI can analyze the code and generate a readable explanation:\n\
            \n``` line-numbers\nfunction processUserData(users) {\n  return users\n\
            \    .filter(user => user.isActive) // Checks the `isActive` value for\
            \ each user and keeps only the objects where `isActive` is true\n    .map(user\
            \ => ({\n      id: user.id, // Retrieves the `id` value from each user\
            \ object\n      name: `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`, // Creates\
            \ a new string by combining `firstName` and `lastName`\n      email: user.email.toLowerCase(),\
            \ // Converts the email address to lowercase\n    }));\n}\n```\n\nIn this\
            \ case, AI not only summarizes the code's functionality but also breaks\
            \ down individual operations into easier-to-understand segments.\n\n##\
            \ AI in Frontend Automation – Translations and Error Detection\n\nEvery\
            \ frontend developer knows that programming isn’t just about creatively\
            \ building interfaces—it also involves many repetitive, tedious tasks.\
            \ One of these is implementing translations for multilingual applications\
            \ (i18n). Adding translations for each key in JSON files and then verifying\
            \ them can be time-consuming and error-prone.\n\nHowever, AI can significantly\
            \ speed up this process. Using [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/), [DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com/),\
            \ or [Claude](https://claude.ai/) allows for automatic generation of translations\
            \ for the user interface, as well as detecting linguistic and stylistic\
            \ errors.\n\n**Example:**\n\nWe have a translation file in JSON format:\n\
            \n```json line-numbers\n{\n  \"welcome_message\": \"Welcome to our application!\"\
            ,\n  \"logout_button\": \"Log out\",\n  \"error_message\": \"Something\
            \ went wrong. Please try again later.\"\n}\n```\n\nAI can automatically\
            \ generate its Polish version:\n\n```json line-numbers\n{\n  \"welcome_message\"\
            : \"Witaj w naszej aplikacji!\",\n  \"logout_button\": \"Wyloguj się\"\
            ,\n  \"error_message\": \"Coś poszło nie tak. Spróbuj ponownie później.\"\
            \n}\n```\n\nMoreover, AI can detect spelling errors or inconsistencies\
            \ in translations. For example, if one part of the application uses \"\
            Log out\" and another says \"Exit,\" AI can suggest unifying the terminology.\n\
            \nThis type of automation not only saves time but also minimizes the risk\
            \ of human errors. And this is just one example – AI also assists in generating\
            \ documentation, writing tests, and optimizing performance, which **we\
            \ will discuss in upcoming articles**.\n\n## Summary\n\nArtificial intelligence\
            \ is transforming the way frontend developers work daily. From generating\
            \ components and refactoring code to detecting errors, automating testing,\
            \ and documentation—AI significantly accelerates and streamlines the development\
            \ process. Without these tools, we would lose a lot of valuable time,\
            \ which we certainly want to avoid.\n\nIn the next parts of this series,\
            \ we will cover topics such as:\n\n- [**How does AI speed up UI component\

            # 01\. Introduction


            In a digital age rife with data breaches and online vulnerabilities, building
            trust is more crucial than ever. Zero knowledge proofs (zk proofs) offer
            an elegant solution beyond traditional privacy measures by allowing one
            party to verify certain information without ever disclosing the information
            itself.


            Experts say zk proofs have the potential to revolutionize various industries,
            from fniance and healthcare to luxury fashion and decentralized systems
            like blockchain, ushering in a new era of security and assurance. Independent
            research shows that zk proof generation will become a $$ 10$ billion market
            by the year 2030. Web3 services will require almost 90 billion zk proofs
            to be performed in 2030, with market-wide completion of 83,000 transactions
            per second.


            This report will cover some familiar zk proof territory, including the
            differences between zk-STARKs and zkSNARKs, a timeline of innovations
            in this space, challenges and future projections. The focus, however,
            is today’s exciting infelction point where zk proofs are moving from research
            projects to serious business – an analysis derived from new and fristhand
            accounts from leading companies within the ecosystem of $2 5 0 +$ companies
            that form the Protocol Labs innovation network. With a shared mission
            to shape the future of computing, PL companies — including CryptoNet,
            Gensyn, Ingonyama, Lurk Lab, Polybase, Rarimo, StarkWare, Zama — have
            contributed to the world of zk proofs for years and will share their exclusive
            insights in this report.


            Companies like Lurk Lab zero in on the complex mathematical models that
            form the basis of zk proofs. They believe the zk proof space is poised
            for growth:


            “There’s been a decade of work to improve zk protocols that are leading
            to real business – we’re even seeing boutique venture capital firms that
            exclusively invest in this space. We are at an inflection point of better
            technology and more capital moving towards zk proofs," said John Burnham,
            cofounder of Lurk Lab. "It’s a Cambrian explosion.”


            This report features exclusive research and expert commentary on the properties
            of zk proofs, use cases, challenges, potential disruptors, signs of momentum
            and future outlook.


            # 益 INGONYAMA


            Ingonyama, a PL network team that solves for hardware limitations by building
            semi-conductors to accelerate zkSNARKs, stresses the importance of privacy
            in the next iteration of the internet:


            ![](https://protocol.ai/images/722213d150008d9ac4b6cda16d916f2604c7927f11ca799b11443efcd4ac882c.jpg)


            Elan Neiger, head of marketing, Ingonyama


            “Information is the most valuable currency in the world. Yet we are all
            guilty of oversharing our data to third parties on the internet. Today
            if you want to prove one aspect of yourself, such as age, you must upload
            an ID which contains so much extra information —  full name, address,
            country of citizenship, etc. What happens to that data? Often we find
            it''s been leaked or stolen. This scenario happens every day in the digital
            world. The problem of oversharing can be solved by zk proofs, which are
            the most powerful cryptography that exists today for hiding data, while
            allowing for assertions on that data. ZK proofs are considered one of
            the greatest achievements of cryptography in the last 50 years.”


            # 02\. What are ZeroKnowledge Proofs?


            Picture this:


            You’re driving in an upscale neighborhood and spot the perfect house.
            You dial the realtor’s number, ready to hear the asking price. What if
            there was a way to prove to the realtor right away that you’re good for
            the money — no matter the cost — without revealing the total amount in
            your bank account? You could maintain your financial privacy and put in
            an offer right away.


            Here enters the concept of a zero knowledge proof (zk proof). In this
            scenario, you present a zk proof to confirm you have enough funds for
            the down payment without revealing your entire bank balance or personal
            wealth. By establishing trust without unnecessary disclosures, zk proofs
            find practical application in various daily scenarios — ensuring secure
            digital transactions, verifying identity without exposing sensitive data,
            and revolutionizing privacy in the digital age.


            In 1985, Shafi Goldwasser, Silvio Micali, and Charles Rackoff first introduced
            the concept of zk proofs to the world. Years later, one of their mentees,
            Rosario Gennaro, a researcher and former data scientist at Protocol Labs,
            wrote a highly cited paper about more efficient, publicly verifiable computer
            schemes that is still relied on today. He shares an example of a zk proof
            with a technical explanation here:


            # Step by Step Example of a ZK Proof


            step 01.

            # Setup


            Emily and David agree on the secret vault''s combination, but they want
            to ensure that Emily truly knows it without exposing it.


            # Prover (Emily)


            Emily takes on the role of the prover. She uses a zk proof technique to
            demonstrate her knowledge of the combination without revealing what it
            is. Instead of showing the combination directly, she performs a series
            of cryptographic operations that prove she possesses the knowledge.


            # step 04.


            ![](https://protocol.ai/images/5bb8a3291d18057072c52a871b177af7de0ed6a25177c70df54e687ed2ce7fdf.jpg)


            # step 03.

            # Proof Generation


            Emily follows David''s instructions using the knowledge she has without
            revealing the combination itself. She provides the result of her operations
            to David.


            # Verifeir (David)


            David is the verifeir in this scenario. He wants to be convinced that
            Emily actually knows the combination. David challenges Emily by asking
            her to prove her knowledge. He provides specifci instructions, such as
            asking her to perform operations on the combination without revealing
            it.


            # step 05.


            # Verifciation


            David checks Emily''s response. If it''s correct based on the instructions
            he provided, he becomes convinced that Emily knows the combination without
            actually learning the combination himself. If Emily didn''t know the combination,
            it would be highly improbable for her to consistently provide correct
            responses based on David''s instructions.


            In this example, the prover (Emily) demonstrates her knowledge of the
            combination to the verifeir (David) without revealing the actual combination.
            This showcases the core concept of zk proofs, where one party can prove
            knowledge of certain information without disclosing that information to
            the other party, ensuring privacy and security in various applications
            like authentication and cryptography.

            2014


            Zcash, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency, adopts zk-SNARKs to enable private
            transactions.


            1992


            Oded Goldreich, Silvio Micali, and Charles Rackoff develop the concept
            of interactive zk proofs, where the verifeir can interact with the prover
            to increase confidence in the proof.


            2002


            Jan Camenisch and Markus Stadler introduce the concept of group signatures
            with effciient zk proofs, allowing members of a group to anonymously sign
            messages while maintaining the integrity of the group.


            2012


            Computer scientist Eli Ben-Sasson announces the concept of zk-SNARKs.


            2018

            A Note on zk-SNARKS vs zk-STARKS


            # 2020


            Filecoin mainnet launches as a decentralized storage network and cryptocurrency.
            Filecoin is currently the largest deployed zk-SNARK to date. By 2023,
            the Filecoin network produces 6-7 million zk-SNARK proofs daily, each
            proof encompassing over 100 million arithmetic constraints.


            # 2022


            The zkSync project releases zkSync 2.0, a new zk rollup that is designed
            to be more effcient and scalable than previous zk rollups.


            Two cryptographic techniques, created in tandem, fall under the umbrella
            of zk proofs: zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs. Both aim to achieve similar goals
            of proving the validity of statements without revealing the underlying
            data, but they differ in their underlying mechanisms and use cases~


            v zk-SNARK is a type of zk proof that allows a prover to demonstrate the
            truth of a statement to a verifeir in a succinct and non-interactive manner.
            It''s particularly associated with privacy-preserving transactions in
            blockchain and cryptocurrency systems, like Zcash.


            v zk-STARK is another type of zk proof that also allows for proving the
            validity of statements without revealing the underlying data. Though it
            requires interaction, it achieves better security by removing the need
            for trusted setups, unlike zk-SNARKs.

            # 04\. Current Major Use Cases


            ZK proofs have found diverse applications across various feilds due to
            their unique ability to verify information without revealing the underlying
            data. Here are fvie major use cases:


            # Voting Systems


            In a zk proof-based voting system, voters can prove that their vote is
            valid without revealing the actual choice they made. This maintains the
            secrecy of individual votes, while ensuring that the total count is accurate.
            Similar to the way they are used today by DAOs, zk proofs can be used
            to verify properties of the election process, such as the absence of double
            voting or the integrity of the tally, without revealing specifci voter
            information.


            # Cryptocurrencies


            Zcash may be the most notable cryptocurrency dedicated to preserving privacy
            – and zk proofs play a crucial role. They enable confdiential transactions
            where the sender, receiver, and transaction amounts are hidden, while
            still ensuring the validity of transactions. ZK proofs can also verify
            the correctness of smart contracts without revealing the underlying data.


            # Decentralized Finance (DeFi)


            Research shows that the DeFi market is growing rapidly and consistently,
            nearly doubling each year since 2018. According to data, the market is
            set to reach $$ 67.4$ billion by 2026. This translates to corresponding
            growth in the zk proof space, as DeFi platforms leverage zk proofs to
            enhance privacy and scalability.


            ZK proofs are used to validate transactions and operations off-chain,
            while providing cryptographic proof of their correctness on-chain. This
            reduces the computational load on the blockchain and speeds up transaction
            processing. ZK proofs can also be used in decentralized exchanges to prove
            that users possess the necessary funds for trading without disclosing
            their exact balances.


            Since 2019, when DeFi was relatively new, its quarter-on-quarter growth
            has risen at a rapid rate, with over 6 million unique wallets completing
            an onchain transaction each month since late-2022.

            # Supply Chain Transparency and Traceability


            ZK proofs can be used to verify and authenticate the origin, movement,
            and authenticity of products within a supply chain without revealing sensitive
            proprietary information. This can enhance transparency by allowing different
            entities to independently verify the accuracy of claims made about products,
            such as their source, quality, and journey through the supply chain. For
            example, zk proofs could be employed to prove that a product was ethically
            sourced, without disclosing proprietary supplier data.


            # Environmental Standards


            ZK proofs can be applied to verify compliance with environmental standards
            without revealing sensitive business data. For instance, companies can
            demonstrate that they meet certain emissions reduction targets without
            sharing specifciemission levels or proprietary information. This aids
            in maintaining transparency and accountability while protecting sensitive
            information.


            # Polybase


            Powered by zk proofs, Polybase is a layer 2 blockchain with private transactions
            and MEV-resistance. A member of the PL innovation network, Polybase’s
            co-founder Sid Gandhi shares an example of an energy use case in the real
            world.


            ![](https://protocol.ai/images/57a8faafaa160f7634285ed48d3ad4b533286e6cd57772b1b119a5e5f7d90a4a.jpg)


            Sid Gandhi, co-founder of Polybase “One of the largest European energy
            companies wants to offer transparent data around renewable energy generation.
            Rather than quarterly manual audits, we look at real time data being generated
            from renewable resources. What percentage of the energy generated and
            sent to this particular client is green? Doing that in a cryptographically
            verifaible way isn''t really possible. Consider data centers that don''t
            want to reveal second-by-second energy data that they are consuming –
            that can be used for competitive intelligence.


            What we allow with zk is the ability to keep that private data private,
            but then prove some public attributes of that data. So we could prove
            points like: what percentage of the data generated at this particular
            time is renewable? That''s a very motivating use case for us, because
            that solves a real problem in the real world that we''ve seen with real
            customers. It''s really exciting for us to be able to tackle this problem.”


            # 05\. 4 Exciting Bets in ZK Proofs


            In the evolving landscape of zk proof technology, there are several projects
            and cutting-edge techniques that are pushing the boundaries of what''s
            possible, with a primary focus on enhancing effciiency, scalability, and
            usability. These innovative efforts are not only shaping the future of
            zk proofs, but also working towards broader adoption across various domains.


            As these projects continue to mature and gain traction, the potential
            for zk proofs to revolutionize industries beyond cryptocurrency becomes
            increasingly evident, offering a promising future where privacy and security
            are paramount in our digital interactions.


            Research shows that


            6 The zk proof market is projected to reach $$ 75$ million in revenue
            in 2024,


            6 Has the potential to exceed $$ 10$ billion in revenue by the year 2030,


            6 Web3 applications alone are expected to require almost 90 billion zk
            proofs in 2030,


            6 The average market clearing price per proof is expected to fall from
            $$ 0.21$ in 2024 to $$ 0.12$ by 2030


            To that end, here are four big bets designed to increase adoption, including
            three top projects and one important technique that is helping build more
            effciient, scalable zk proof systems.


            # zkEVM


            A concept within the Ethereum ecosystem aimed at developing a zk proof
            system that is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It
            involves various stakeholders, including developers, researchers, and
            the Ethereum community. This would allow zk proofs to be used for a wide
            variety of Ethereum applications.


            # 2 zkSync


            A method and project focused on developing zk rollups, a type of layer
            2 scaling solution for Ethereum. ZK rollups use zk proofs to bundle multiple
            transactions together, verify them off-chain, and then submit a single
            proof to the Ethereum mainnet. This signifciantly reduces the computational
            load on the Ethereum network and enhances its scalability. Examples8


            ^ zkSync is also the name of a specifci project that has been developed
            to implement this method. It is initiated and maintained by Matter Labs,
            a company focused on improving the scalability and usability of blockchain
            networks. The zkSync project includes the development of the zkSync protocol,
            smart contract infrastructure, and associated toolsA


            Emerging zk rollups, such as zkSync Era, have witnessed a growth in their
            total value locked (TVL) surging to $$ 668$ million in June 30, 2023,
            according to Crypto.com.  This signifeis an impressive $6 6 0 %$ increase
            from $$ 88$ million on April 1, 2023A


            Research shows that the Total Value Locked (TVM) in ZK rollups is currently
            over $$ 7.5 B$ to date. Mid-September 2021 saw all scaling solutions adoption,
            including zk rollups, skyrocket:

            # 3 zk-STARKs


            There''s exciting development around this proof system that is even more
            efficient and scalable than previous systems. This could make zk proofs
            practical for a wider range of applications.


            Recursive zk proofs


            A technique that allows for the aggregation of multiple proofs into a
            single proof, drastically reducing the computational overhead of verification.
            This innovation has contributed to improved scalability in zk proof systems,
            making them more efficient for applications with a high transaction volume. 
            Usually, the way it is used is in evolving computation: First, it breaks
            the computation to be proven into smaller steps and proves them iteratively.
            Each step contains a proof, proving the current state of the computation.
            Then, a new proof for the next step can be generated by using the current
            step and its proof recursively showing the correctness of all prior steps
            alltogether. The proof update does not require recomputing from the very
            first step as in a standard zk proof, and it is independent of the total
            length of the computation.

            PL network team team StarkWare is a zk-STARK proof pioneer, bringing privacy
            to the blockchain with over $1 trillion of cumulative trading done to
            date. The team believes recursive proofs hold particular promise:

            “The beneftis of recursion will be realized gradually, as it continues
            to allow for new improvements, and it will soon deliver hyper-scale, cut
            gas fees, and improve latency by unlocking the potential of parallelization.
            Further optimization of the Recursive Verifeir is on-going and even better
            performance and cost beneftis are expected to be provided over time.”

            # ZK x AI and Machine Learning (ZKML)


            ZK proofs applied to machine learning, a sub-field of AI, hold particular
            promise. As AI-generated content becomes increasingly indistinguishable
            from human-created content, zero knowledge cryptography could be used
            to verify that a specific piece of content was produced by a specific
            LLM. This could be done by creating a zero knowledge circuit representation
            of the model, which would allow the content to be verified without revealing

            Gensyn network is the L1 Machine Learning Compute Protocol that provides
            developers with ultra-low cost, P2P, access to all of the world’s compute.
            The PL network team finds particular promise in the intersection of the
            ZK world and machine learning (ZKML).

            Harry Grieve, Co-Founder of Gensyn “ZK proofs are different enough that
            it’s hard to build a generalized market. The key takeaway here is the
            vertical specific applications; notably, in Zero Knowledge Machine Learning
            (ZKML) where it has two interesting use-cases: reducing compute verification
            overheads (e.g. for Machine Learning Compute Protocols like Gensyn), or
            proving that a given Machine Learning model has been applied (e.g. a fraud
            fliter running on the Worldcoin hardware).”


            PL network team Rarify Labs is a service provider and community member
            dedicated to advancing the nextgeneration interoperability protocol Rarimo.
            Rarimo focuses on the identity space, which is one of the most mature
            and promising markets for zk proofs.

            “The zk proof market is highly promising and already moving towards tangible
            use cases. Identities are at the heart of the rapidly expanding decentralized
            social layer, including decentralized social media, DAOs, reputation systems,
            and on-chain gaming. Moreover, the use of zk proofs is accelerating due
            to the urgency with which identity credentials are needed both within
            Web3 and Web2 as AIgenerated bots and deep-fakes make it increasingly
            diffciult to discern humans – and human-generated content – from machines
            and AI-generated content.”


            # 07\. Challenges & Hurdles


            ZK proofs offer exciting possibilities for privacy, security, and efficiency.
            However, they also come with several technical challenges and adoption
            barriers for researchers, developers, and practitioners working in the
            realm of zk proofs. These multifaceted issues range from efficiency and
            scalability limitations to concerns about security assumptions and real
            world implications. By addressing these challenges, the cryptographic
            community can pave the way for the broader utilization of zk proofs in
            domains ranging from blockchain and cybersecurity to privacypreserving
            technologies and beyond. Here are five challenges currently in focus:


            Many zk proof systems involve the use of sophisticated cryptographic operations
            applied to a complex mathematical representation of a computer program.
            This complexity can make it challenging for developers to adopt and integrate
            zk proofs into their applications. It also affects the efficiency and
            scalability of large-scale zk systems.


            ![](https://protocol.ai/images/fb5421daeedb061e8120870a026a84e8145c131a0091a8bf99630f53ab0bc37f.jpg)


            “The main challenge is around the balance of cost, time and proof size.
            This is the Holy Grail: to generate a proof with zero overhead and super
            small proof size. Now, we have achieved super small proof sizes, but with
            other big trade-offs. Generally the trade-off is: it becomes more expensive.”


            # Scalability


            While zk proofs can aggregate multiple proofs and transactions, scalability
            challenges can arise when dealing with a high volume of transactions.
            Generating and verifying a large number of proofs may introduce bottlenecks.
            Achieving strong privacy guarantees through zk proofs might involve trade-offs
            in terms of transaction speed, network overhead, or computational load.
            Striking the right balance between privacy and performance is crucial.


            Research scientist Rosario Gennaro explains that building a zk proof involves
            running a program that stores the state of the virtual machine at every
            step of the proof, making space a bottleneck to growth and speed of transaction.
            Folding schemes present a solution for proofs that are computed at every
            step of a computation: given a proof with correct computation up to, for
            example, step 4, the next correctness proof is obtain by "folding" the
            proof of correctness of step 5 into the previous proof, without the need
            to store the state of the computation at every stage.


            “Instead of writing the entire transcript for the computation down at
            each step, folding compresses the computation and solves the space problem.
            There is a lot of work happening on implementing folding schemes to build
            effciient zk virtual machines, ranging from Web2 companies like Microsoft
            to cutting edge startups like Lurk Lab. While this bottleneck hasn’t been
            fully resolved, it’s one area where we are ahead of the curve to solve
            the issue and defniitely an area to watch.”

            # 3 Trusted Setup


            Some zk proof systems require a trusted setup phase to generate initial
            parameters. The trusted setup phase requires that the individuals or entity
            responsible for generating these parameters act honestly and do not keep
            any secret information that could compromise the security of the system.
            If this setup is compromised or not performed correctly, it can undermine
            the security and privacy guarantees of the system. The field of zk proofs
            is rapidly evolving, with new advancements and potential vulnerabilities
            regularly emerging. Continuous research and development are essential
            to address security issues and improve the efficiency of zk proof systems.


            # Interoperability


            Different zk proof systems might use distinct standards and protocols,
            making it challenging to achieve interoperability between different systems.
            Creating common standards would enhance compatibility and efforts are
            currently underway with the likes of The ZKProof Community. ZK proofs
            also often come with proof sizes that can be large, making them less efficient
            to transmit and store. Efforts to minimize proof size while maintaining
            security are ongoing. To support standardization, Polybase has released
            a new zk benchmark site,  [https://zkbench.dev/](https://zkbench.dev/),
            with detailed comparison tables and open community reviews.


            # Polybase


            ![](https://protocol.ai/images/ae13242654fa028b714ea18e364129ca8fe53916bc7b3d43c7cb4eef962bbdff.jpg)


            Sid Gandhi, co-founder of Polybase “We''re at that phase in the industry
            where people understand the high level capability, like keeping data private,
            proving things publicly, but there is still a big educational aspect around
            the trade-offs and the technical implementation, and, potentially, what
            other options are available, what trade-offs exist with those options
            as well. So, we are doing quite a bit of education. And then, the next
            step after that is selling our actual product. So it''s a two-step process
            right now.”


            Hardware acceleration techniques, such as using trusted execution environments
            (TEEs) or specialized hardware like ASICs, have enabled faster and more
            effciient computation of zk proofs. This breakthrough has the potential
            to make zk proofs practical for real-time applications.


            # INGONYAMA


            ![](https://protocol.ai/images/29f853f49ca3214ad5600fa7864b1314cc41b382a63fc4b3e998c2266f6f650e.jpg)


            Elan Neiger, head of marketing, Ingonyama


            “Today''s hardware is not built for zero knowledge. ZK proofs require
            a massive amount of computational resources and existing hardware (CPUs,
            GPUs) are not designed to handle this computation effciiently. The main
            bottleneck is proof generation, which is still too slow and expensive.
            In terms of timing, zk algorithms have been developed for four decades,
            and zk software engineering for about 10 years. The missing ingredient
            is specialized hardware in order to accelerate proof generation, which
            is needed in order to commoditize the technology and make it accessible
            to everyone.


            ZK proof generation must be an order of magnitude faster than it is today
            for real world use-cases. And that''s what we''re working on. Most of
            the demand today comes from the blockchain industry for scaling and privacy,
            but what makes me even more excited for zk proofs is the fact that once
            we get outside of the Web3 ecosystem, zk can impact nearly every industry,
            from medical research to AI, to decentralized ID, to new online multiplayer
            gaming architectures, and beyond.”


            # 08\. The Future of ZK Proofs


            # Seamlessness


            The industry is evolving at a rapid pace, with a focus on moving from
            research to a business-led model. On one hand, the near future is focused
            on addressing challenges and roadblocks in this space, which include hardware
            acceleration and faster computation. Here, PL network teams share their
            top three projections for the zk proof space in the near future.


            In the next 2-5 years, Rarify Labs expects an era of widespread integration
            of zk proofs across multiple protocols and technologies. Its presence
            will revolutionize privacy, digital identities, and blockchain performance,
            all while being seamless and mostly invisible to users, similar to the
            way SSL and secure enclaves in phones are invisible to users. ZK technology
            will have a user-centric folw that enables scaling and accessibility across
            the digital identity space.


            ![](https://protocol.ai/images/93240bae4837b2d87747a0adf013f1b49b4facf9671433903e6d3ee27d3f0c07.jpg)


            “ZK proofs will help dissolve the boundaries between Web2 and Web3, particularly
            within the identity space as it is currently the only technology that
            sits across both realms. More generally, zk proofs will massively reduce
            computation complexity and help deliver truly performant blockchains.”


            Client side integration


            In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptography, Ingonyama believes zk
            proofs will transcend server-side applications and find their place within
            the very devices we carry in our pockets. Imagine the power of a world
            with zk proof hardware embedded directly in your mobile device, capable
            of running a proof of ownership or proof of personhood.


            “We envision a future in which zk is not just running on the server side
            like data centers and cloud, but also on the client side – in mobile phones
            and gaming machines. ZK technology is fundamental to trustless compute.
            We''re working to make efficient, zk proof hardware accelerators that
            can run everywhere.” said Elan Neiger, marketing lead at Ingonyama.


            ![](https://protocol.ai/images/d7ab40f9d282cec8390d118d4b1097a23aca95daa785d3c6342d59e0c9e09751.jpg)


            # Cost efficient proofs


            As zk proof methods evolve and proofs themselves become smaller in size
            and more cost effective, they will become an attractive option within
            the realm of the Internet of Things (IoT). Currently, IoT devices store
            all their data in centralized storage and data is stored directly onto
            their servers. ZK proofs allow for proofs to be used in place of stored
            data, creating efficiencies and cutting costs.


            # INGONYAMA


            ![](https://protocol.ai/images/4807ccd6bafbd46d2660cf41f31eec2d195de8f30856d36594f9885c30f3cdbb.jpg)


            Elan Neiger, head of marketing, Ingonyama


            “Another focus for the future of zk lies with the Internet of Things (IoT).
            With zero knowledge, it will be possible to cut the costs of data storage,
            by sending proofs instead of data to confirm that specific stages or conditions
            have been met. Zero-Knowledge also allows for yes /  no answers to complex
            questions involving data or sensitive personal information. For example:
            do you have enough money in your bank account to buy this car - Yes or
            no?  ZK today is still a small market, but growing, because it is the
            most powerful cryptography that exists for hiding data, while allowing
            for assertions on that data.”


            Education and standardization are key to the evolution of zk proofs. To
            that end, Ingonyama launched an open source community effort in August
            2023: Ingopedia, a repo for all things zk for beginners and experts, ranging
            from video tutorials to academic research (link). Ingopedia has been widely
            cited as a good place to dive into the deep end of zero knowledge.


            # Potential Disruptors


            As the industry evolves, researchers and developers are keeping an eye
            out for potential disruptors. These include quantum computers, homomorphic
            encryption and interdisciplinary innovations:


            If large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers become a reality, they
            could potentially break certain cryptographic primitives that underpin
            zk proofs. However, should quantum computing become a reality, we will
            have to change all the deployed cryptographic schemes. There is already
            great progress with quantum-resistant encryption to date and industry
            leaders are making strides with quantum resistant SNARKs as well.


            “All is not lost with the advent of quantum computing. In the future,
            we will see quantum resistant SNARKs. We know how to do quantum resistant
            encryption at this point. Should a quantum computer show up tomorrow,
            it will change everything. It won’t happen overnight, but we''ll get there.”

            # Homomorphic Encryption


            Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) allows computations to be performed
            on encrypted data without the need to decrypt it. FHE and zk proofs serve
            different roles in cryptography, and their use cases often complement
            each other rather than disrupt each other. While FHE can be used for secure
            computation and privacy-preserving data analysis, zk proofs are typically
            employed for proving statements about data or knowledge without revealing
            that data or knowledge. However, if zk proofs over FHE computations were
            deployed, it could enable a new level of privacy-preserving computation,
            where not only the data, but also the operations performed on the data
            remain hidden. This would have significant implications for secure cloud
            computing, private data analysis, and more.


            Actively building in this space, PL network team Zama is building an open
            source framework that enables developers to use homomorphic encryption
            to secure their Web2 and Web3 apps, without having to know cryptography.
            The homomorphic programs can then be deployed locally, to the cloud or
            to their upcoming decentralized infrastructure.

            Rand Hindi, co-founder of Zama


            “While zk’s strength is in verifiability, FHE focuses on privacy. When
            you combine the two together, you have the ideal solution, because you
            can have confidential computing that is actually verified. And so it''s
            an area we’re very excited about. But zk has difficulty scaling existing
            tech. The way you implement zk is complicated, you have to resort to incredibly
            complex protocols. By contrast, FHE is just a smart contract running on-chain,
            like every other smart contract. But again, FHE cannot do what zk does,
            which is to prove that a computation is correct. This is why the future
            will likely see compatibility between the two, with zk for verifiability
            and FHE for privacy.”

            # Interdisciplinary Innovations


            As the adoption of zk proofs expands, experts from various fields may
            come together to create novel applications and protocols. For example,
            collaborations between cryptographers, blockchain developers, AI researchers,
            and economists could lead to innovative solutions that we can''t foresee
            yet. This cross-pollination of ideas might result in entirely new use
            cases and disruptive applications for zk proofs.

            Harry Grieve, Co-Founder of Gensyn “Platforms will mature to the point
            where they’re ready for production use and then (hopefully) many applications
            will start appearing beyond the current under-the-hood/ scalability systems
            like zkEVMs or the current iteration of Starknet. We’re most excited about
            the applications in machine learning.”


            Recommendations & Advice


            # Stay Updated with Research


            Zero knowledge proofs is an evolving field with constant advancements.
            Stay updated with the latest research papers, conferences, and discussions
            in cryptography and related domains to remain informed about new techniques
            and developments.


            # Experiment and Prototype


            Start by experimenting with existing zk proof libraries and tools. Creating
            prototypes will give you hands-on experience and help you grasp the practical
            aspects of using zk proofs. Collaborate with other researchers, developers,
            and experts in the field. It''s a great way to learn the strengths and
            limitations of different zk proof systems.


            # Focus on Real-World Applications


            While theoretical research is important, also consider practical applications.
            Think about how zk proofs can solve real-world problems like privacy-preserving
            data sharing, secure authentication, or improving blockchain scalability.

            “After many years, we fnially have effciient proof schemes. By effciient,
            I mean that the prover time versus the normal computation time is getting
            closer and closer. The closer we get, the more we can have more applications
            that can be verifeid. In 2023, it''s close enough to verify blockchain
            transactions. And maybe in the future, it can be closer to verify any
            computation.”

            Recursive proofs: A type of proof that involves using a zk proof as a
            building block within another zk proof, allowing for more complex and
            layered privacy-preserving computations.


            R1CS (Rank-1 Constraint System): This is a mathematical framework used
            to represent computations as a set of constraints, making it possible
            to construct zk proofs for a wide range of applications, including blockchain
            and privacy-preserving protocols.


            Linear prover time: Refers to the desirable characteristic of zk proofs
            where the time it takes to generate a proof is directly proportional to
            the complexity of the computation being proven, making them efficient
            for practical use cases.


            PlonK: A highly efficient zk proof system that stands for "Permutations
            over Lagrange-bases for oecumenical noninteractive arguments of knowledge,"
            known for its scalability and performance in cryptographic applications.


            zk-STARK: (Zero knowledge Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge)
            is a type of zk proof that offer transparency and scalability while allowing
            one party to prove the knowledge of certain information without revealing
            that information itself.


            zk-SNARK: (Zero knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge)
            is a class of zk proofs that enable one party to prove to another that
            they possess certain information without revealing the information itself,
            while also being highly efficient and requiring minimal interaction.


            Proof size: The amount of data required to represent and transmit a zk
            proof, which is a critical factor in assessing the efficiency and practicality
            of a zk proof system.


            Verifier time: The computational effort required by a verifier to verify
            the validity of a zk proof, which is important for assessing the practicality
            and efficiency of a zk proof system.


            ZKML: (Zero knowledge Machine Learning) is a concept that combines machine
            learning techniques with zk proofs to enable the training and utilization
            of machine learning models without exposing the underlying data used for
            training.


            zkEVM: A concept within the Ethereum ecosystem aimed at developing a zk
            proof system that is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
            It involves various stakeholders, including developers, researchers, and
            the Ethereum community. This would allow zk proofs to be used for a wide
            variety of Ethereum applications.


            zkSync: A method and project focused on developing zk rollups, a type
            of layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. ZK rollups use zk proofs to
            bundle multiple transactions together, verify them off-chain, and then
            submit a single proof to the Ethereum mainnet. This signifciantly reduces
            the computational load on the Ethereum network and enhances its scalability.


            ZK rollup: A type of Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. zk rollups
            use zk proofs to bundle multiple transactions together, verify them off-chain,
            and then submit a single proof to the Ethereum mainnet.


            Folding: A technique used to reduce the size and complexity of a zk proof,
            making it more effciient and practical for verifciation while preserving
            its security properties.'

            In the past thread on ZKPs or Zero-Knowledge, we spoke at length about
            what ZKP is all about and how it has revolutionized scaling of the [decentralized](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/use-cases-of-blockchain-in-decentralized-storage/)
            ecosystem. In this thread today, we shall look at the projects which have
            been stimulating the adoption of zero-knowledge proof. Though the majority
            of the L2s have preferred optimistic [rollups](https://www.zeeve.io/rollups/)
            because their architecture is quite simple to deploy when compared to
            a ZKP, we shall look at a few projects which have done unparalleled work
            to allow ZKPs to rise with time.


            ## Top Projects on ZKPs to Drive  Enterprise Level Adoption of Blockchain


            ### 1- StarkEx


            [Enterprises](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/why-is-private-blockchain-network-suitable-for-enterprise/)
            are desperately vying to deploy the decentralization aspect in their modus-operandi,
            but it is the scalability and secrecy which has hindered adoption. StarkEx,
            a Layer 2 or L2 scaling solution has endeavored to improve scalability
            and privacy of the [blockchains](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/a-detailed-guide-on-blockchain-node-infrastructure)
            through the introduction of SNARKs or zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive
            argument on knowledge.


            StarkEx uses lightweight cryptographic hash-functions that helps in restoring
            computational integrity which is pivotal for scaling the [blockchain ecosystem](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/quintessential-beginners-guide-to-baas-blockchain-as-a-service). 
            For example, suppose if we transcend in time and look at mainstream adoption
            of blockchain where we see [decentralized](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/use-cases-of-blockchain-in-decentralized-storage/)
            ATMs competing with TradFi. At such times, the need for computational
            integrity will be felt at the maximum.


            Building an entire ecosystem that ensures computation without the intervention
            of a third party but with the same level of trust requires futuristic
            computational prowess. StartEK has already achieved that through its battle-tested
            integration of ZK-starks that do not require a trusted third party to
            set up the ZKP systems. Hence, it is being widely used by exchanges and
            [DeFi protocols](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/) to scale
            their ecosystem. At the moment, DiversiFi and DyDx have used StarkEx to
            scale up their operations with minimum gas costs and higher scalability.


            However, the trade-off of StarkEX is the computational Integrity bolstering
            commerce. Though most of the [public blockchains](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/)
            do achieve this; they compromise the scalability and privacy of operations.


            ### 2- StarkNet


            Composability with the Ethereum chain is a pressing concern that has obstructed
            the adoption of ZK technology in business operations. Most businesses
            have trusted the [Ethereum Network](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-ethereum-blockchain/)
            for its decentralization, security and hack-proof track record. However
            they do have a concern while hosting their operations on the main-chain.
            StarkNet, a general purpose ZKP allows faster deployment of dApps on its
            ecosystem. StarkNet pushes for integrity  of computation through the use
            of level 2 cryptographic proofs and modern Algebra.


            On top of this, StarkNet is also providing the same composability level
            as [Ethereum](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-ethereum-blockchain/)
            allowing developers to further speed up the development process and come
            up with advanced solutions as and when required. Along with this, StarkNet
            provides true anonymity by not letting the user’s identity be derived
            from public keys and supporting multi-calls or multiple transactions in
            one single call to settle the accounts. Hence it significantly reduces
            flow of data from the off-chain computational layer to the main parent
            chain, which is [Ethereum](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-ethereum-blockchain/).


            ### 3- Miden


            [Polygon](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-polygon-blockchain/)
            has been leading by example when it comes to developing and building ZKP
            projects to make sure that their dream of onboarding the next billion
            users to Ethereum doesn’t go unanswered. For that reason, [Polygon](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-polygon-blockchain/)
            Technologies have directed all the focus towards scaling the Ethereum
            chain. Their $1 billion corpus investment to develop revolutionary ZK
            projects like Miden, Hermes, Zero and Nightfall have already steered their
            ambition towards the right direction.


            Miden, which was rolled out in 2021 is already making headlines. As a
            STARK based ZKP, Miden aims to provide 1,000 to 2,000 TPS which shall
            move higher to even 20,000 TPS once sharding goes live on [Ethereum](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-ethereum-blockchain/).
            Miden will cut dependency on third party validators with ready to deploy
            solutions. At the same time, it will be using lean cryptography which
            would make it resilient to quantum attacks in the near future. The Miden
            Virtual Machine will support arbitrary programs which will eliminate cryptographic
            complexities and allow developers to quickly design and deploy the system.


            Such an upside is decisive for the adoption of ZKP because the narrative
            that floats at present is developing the ZKP solution is complex and commands
            a lot of resources. Through Miden, [Polygon](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-polygon-blockchain/)
            aims to solve that complexity by introducing Solidity compatible EVM [smart-contracts](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/smart-contract-standardization-a-necessity-for-the-large-scale-adoption-of-blockchain/)
            streamlining quick deployment.


            ### 4- Polygon Zero


            [Polygon](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-polygon-blockchain/)
            Zero is another ambitious project which shall outsmart all other ZKPs
            that are capable of scaling TPS. The Plonky2 recursive SNARK will take
            only 170 milliseconds for generating a recursive proof to the transaction.
            Due to such a feature, ZERO ZKPs will be giving very tough competition
            to its competitors in terms of latency and fees.


            They would be much lower since the blobs of data will be created and destroyed
            in no time to free up space and reduce toxic waste  for better  scaling 
            the Ethereum base layer.


            Another trade-off of the Zero ZKP is its ability to run solidity codes
            transpiled into ZK Bytecodes making it compatible with the Ethereum ecosystem
            and ensure quick deployment of the solution.


            ### 5- Polygon Hermez


            There’s a new buzzword lately in the crypto scape: Zk EVM or Zero Knowledge
            Ethereum Virtual Machine. Since Hermez has already achieved unprecedented
            feats by becoming the very first decentralized ZKP on [Ethereum](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-ethereum-blockchain/)
            mainnet, Hermez 2.0 is poised to further solidify that claim. Under Hermez
            1, Polygon has already touched 2,000 TPS, but there’s more room for improvement
            that Hermes 2 will accomplish.


            Right at the moment, developers have to face real challenges when allowing
            ZKP to directly communicate with the Ethereum mainnet. Or put simply,
            one has to develop everything from scratch which adheres to EVM compatibility.
            Hermez 1.- ZkEVM will execute Ethereum transactions in a fully decentralized
            and transparent way.


            Once this would roll, it would eliminate users and Dapp frictions that
            happen when interacting with ZKPs and the main-layer of [ETH](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-ethereum-blockchain/).
            Hermez 2.0 will be using the proof-of-efficiency( P-o-E) because the P-o-D
            or Proof-of-Donation model was vulnerable to attacks at the bootstrapping
            levels. Since if a donating verifier goes rogue, it leads to a delay.


            Hence the team chose the PoE model since it ensured permissionless opportunity
            to produce the L2 batches and kept the right balance between overall validation
            effort and the value in the network. Furthermore, Hermez 2 also introduces
            zkASM which helps in taking complete control in the development and design
            of the architecture in the manner that the project demands, instead of
            an already cookie cutter approach provided. In this way, new projects
            need not have to struggle since they already have a pre-built infrastructure
            from where they can make adjustments and scale up their operations. These
            aspects make Hermez 2.0 a revolutionary solution for scaling the projects
            while maintaining the same degree of security provided by the Ethereum
            mainchain.


            ### 6- Polygon Nightfall


            At the moment, Optimistic roll ups have been deployed across 75% of [DeFi](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/banking-the-unbanked-defi-promoting-financial-inclusion/);
            but they do struggle with the withdrawal time which is seven days. Polygon’s
            core aim is to give very high grade security and scalability solutions
            to [enterprises](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/8-emerging-enterprise-blockchain-trends-to-follow-in-2022/).
            Hence they came up with Nightfall which will introduce the perfect amalgamation
            of ZKPs and Optimistic roll-ups to impart privacy, scalability and gas
            cost optimization to the users.


            The privacy preserving roll-ups that [Polygon](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-polygon-blockchain/)
            has introduced in Nightfall only reveal the time and date of the transaction.
            Whereas, the [optimistic rollups](https://www.zeeve.io/appchains/optimistic-rollups/)
            assume every transaction to be valid; however, it does allow the challenging
            period to validate the authenticity of the transaction. In this way, Polygon,
            through Nightfall, has been instrumental towards empowering SCM or [Supply
            Chain](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/transforming-supply-chain-finance-with-blockchain)
            Management, [NFT](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/dynamic-nfts-new-world-for-nfts)
            markets and blockchain mixers to scale up their operations. Ernst & Young
            E & Y is already in talks with Polygon and they have empowered EY Opschain
            and EY Blockchain Analyser using the Polygon Nightfall ZKPs.


            ### 7- Metis


            Metis has been another key driver from the [Polygon](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-polygon-blockchain/)
            family which has been designed in such a way to help optimistic roll-ups
            occupy center stage when it comes to scaling the ETH’s base layer. As
            you can see in the opening of this blog, Vitalik Buterin, the founder
            of [Ethereum](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-ethereum-blockchain/)
            has been quite favoring ZKPs when compared to [Optimistic rollups](https://www.zeeve.io/appchains/optimistic-rollups/).


            His major concern however  was the withdrawal time for funds since optimistic
            roll-ups take more than 7 days and by that time, the funds are locked
            within the [smart-contract](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/smart-contract-standardization-a-necessity-for-the-large-scale-adoption-of-blockchain/).
            The objective of Metis ZKP is to completely disrupt that model with a
            new noble solution.


            In the new validation model as proposed by the Metis ZKP, there will be
            a multi-party fraud detection system. Due to this mechanism, an additional
            layer of security will be created while finalizing the transaction which
            is called the Metis Ranger System.


            Under the Metis Ranger system, the validators/rangers are given specific
            blocks as samples. These rangers first audit the transaction and provide
            validity proofs first-in hand before the mainchain validators can challenge
            the transaction. Due to this process, the validation and withdrawal times
            that took weeks on the layer 1’s or mainchain could be completed in hours
            and minutes to scale up the use of optimistic [rollups](https://www.zeeve.io/rollups/)
            in scaling requirements.


            ### 8- ZK Sync


            What’s the biggest challenge in the blockchain space? Answering to the
            blockchain trilemma: (i) Decentralization (ii) Security (iii) Scalability.
            If you deep dive into L1s, all of them face the same challenge. Though
            Algorand claims to have solved the Trilemma, yet the claims remain subject
            to contention since everyone can become a validator on PPoS consensus
            of Algorand but the Round Robin validator selection goes to the highest
            staker.


            ZKs have solved the scalability challenges but their process remains much
            debatable. For example, most of the validators cannot participate in validating
            the entire transaction volume. As a result of this, the problem of censorship,
            DD-o-S and centralization looms larger.


            Through [ZkSync](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-zksync-era-node/),
            a new way of validating the transaction will be made possible.. There
            will be validators and guardians with the validators given the role to
            pack the transaction in batches and they need to submit security bonds
            which are always higher than the txs they validate. In this way, it makes
            the transactions safe. At the same time, to check that validators do not
            go rogue by controlling the network, the guardians who are majority [token](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/comprehensive-guide-on-tokenized-real-world-assets/)
            holders choose the validators in random manner.


            These guardians need not have to run the computation on high-end computing
            devices. They can choose to control a fraction of the network with even
            a basic laptop; thus making the process of validation completely decentralized
            due to no entry barrier. On top of this, they are also not eligible for
            slashing, hence more people would join to make the ecosystem completely
            decentralized. That’s how [ZKSyncs](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-zksync-era-node/)
            are functioning to provide true [decentralization](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/use-cases-of-blockchain-in-decentralized-storage/),
            security and scalability to the main chains.


            ### 9- Loopring


            Loopring has been instrumental towards simplifying trading in cryptocurrencies
            with a complete non-custodial and highly anonymous set-up for traders.
            The project also aims to solve the challenges of liquidity, scalability
            and user experience through the use of ZKP. In the Loopring operational
            mode, in order to scale DEX or [Decentralized](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/use-cases-of-blockchain-in-decentralized-storage/)
            Exchanges, Loopring is introducing a hybrid model of ZKP.


            In the Hybrid ZKP model offered by Loopring, order-messaging will be handled
            off-chain, whereas, and settlement will happen on-chain on a real-time
            basis with no delays.


            Loopring will use the ZKP that will relay information to the mainchain
            by the prover that they have done some computation. The Merkle-trees will
            display the complete transaction history and a smart-contract will be
            checking the same to provide real-time data sets to the mainchain for
            recording transactions.


            In this way, Loopring aims to completely revolutionize trading through
            DEX where the order model will be fast, efficient,  economical and completely
            non-custodial in nature. Along with this, Loopring introduces the standalone
            exchange contracts which will make transactions completely secretive providing
            adequate privacy to the users; thus allowing different DEXes to cooperate
            using the ZKP model to exchange information and execute trades. They can
            do so using the same exchange contract which shall stimulate liquidity
            and faster settlements as and when required to scale decentralized exchanges.


            ### 10- Mina


            Though we say that [Ethereum](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-ethereum-blockchain/)
            and [BItcoin blockchains](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-bitcoin-blockchain/)
            are heavily decentralized, they come with a downside for those who want
            to run the full-nodes. They need to download the complete full node from
            the Genesis Block to the day they wish to run the [full-node](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/what-is-a-full-node-a-detailed-guide/).
            This creates an entry barrier since Bitcoin blockchain has a 437 GB block
            size and Ethereum has 1 TB. Mina ends up as an amenable choice to resolve
            this problem.


            It is the world’s lightest blockchain running a 22KB block. To ensure
            scalability and high throughput, the Mina blockchain uses the Ouroboros
            Samasika consensus mechanism that uses a modified [PoS](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/a-complete-guide-on-proof-of-stake-pos-in-cryptocurrency/)
            model. However, to further scale the ecosystem, Mina uses the SNARK mechanism
            to validate the transactions. However this SNARK is unlike the others
            talked about.


            The SNARK validators open a SnarketPlace. On the Snarketplace, they publish
            the ZK proofs on the Snarketplace and block producers  will be bidding
            for the Snark Proofs. The most competitive bid wins the auction and they
            need to share a part of their block produced rewards with the SNARK workers/validators.
            In this way, the system remains truly decentralized, scalable and incentivizing
            for anyone to enter and exit the system.


            Mina has envisaged a new economic model which maintains anonymity, economic
            incentives and even scales the ecosystem through the use of ZKPs.


            Stay Tuned since we will be posting more threads that shall cover all
            other nuances of ZKPs and how they will shape the future of blockchain.

            # Zero-Knowledge Proofs: Emerging Opportunities for the Insurance Industry


            October 2023


            ### **Authors**


            Stefano Chiaradonna (Ph.D. Candidate)


            Petar Jevtić, Ph.D. (PI)


            Dragan Boscovic, Ph.D. (Co-PI)


            ### Description


            Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) represent an innovative suite of cryptographic
            algorithms that empower various parties, especially the insurance community,
            to validate the accuracy of sensitive information without revealing the
            actual information itself. When implemented, it could help the insurance
            industry authenticate policyholders and beneficiaries more efficiently,
            faster and, with fraud prevention mechanisms, it could facilitate communication
            with distribution channels, reinsurers or other stakeholders. Industry
            standards have not yet emerged and various technological solutions offer
            various tradeoffs. Thus, this report introduces the diverse applications
            and emerging opportunities that ZKPs offer to the insurance community,
            especially in the health insurance space.

            ## Description


            Research on blockchain has found that the technology is no silver bullet
            compared to traditional data structures due to limitations regarding decentralization,
            security, and scalability. These limitations are summarized in the blockchain
            trilemma, which today represents the greatest barrier to blockchain adoption
            and applicability. To address these limitations, recent advancements by
            blockchain businesses have focused on a new cryptographic technique called
            "Zero-knowledge proofs". While these primitives have been around for some
            time and despite their potential significance on blockchains, not much
            is known in information systems research about them and their potential
            effects. Therefore, we employ a multivocal literature review to explore
            this new tool and find that although it has the potential to resolve the
            trilemma, it currently only solves it in certain dimensions, which necessitates
            further attention and research.

            Pedersen commitment scheme \[^2\].


            The security of ZKPs relies on the hardness of certain mathematical problems,
            such as:


            - **The discrete logarithm problem**: A problem that involves finding
            the discrete logarithm of a given element in a finite field. This problem
            is thought to be hard, and its hardness is used to secure many cryptographic
            protocols, including ZKPs \[^3\].


            The following equation illustrates the discrete logarithm problem:


            y=gxmodpy = g^x \\mod py=gxmodp


            where ggg is a generator of a finite field, xxx is the discrete logarithm,
            and ppp is a prime number.


            ## Conclusion


            Zero-Knowledge Proofs have the potential to revolutionize the field of
            cryptography and data security. While significant progress has been made,
            there are still several challenges and limitations that need to be addressed.
            As research continues to advance, we can expect to see increased adoption
            of ZKPs in various industries and applications.

            ## What is Zero-Knowledge Proof?


            Zero-knowledge proof; ZKP is a technology in which a person who wants
            to prove something (Prover; hereafter referred to as P) proves the fact
            that he knows the knowledge without giving any other knowledge to the
            person who wants to verify it (Verifier; hereafter referred to as V).


            As a result, V can only verify the fact that P knows the knowledge without
            obtaining any other knowledge (Figure 1).


            ![](https://nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img01.png?h=378&iar=0&w=800&rev=6d7d71ac7c564b25984a2df33508640b)


            Figure 1: Concept of Zero-Knowledge Proof



            In the real world, when you want to assert that you hold certain credentials,
            it is common to present evidence to convince the other person that you
            hold the credentials.


            However, when you do so, the other person may be presented with too much
            information about what you want to prove, such as your address or age
            in the evidence. If you cannot trust the other person, you may feel uncomfortable
            giving them too much information. However, if you don''t show them the
            evidence, they are unlikely to trust your claim. How can you convince
            someone that you hold the qualification without giving them extra information?


            The technology to achieve this is zero-knowledge proof. The idea of zero-knowledge
            proof originated in cryptography research in the 1980s (\*2).


            - (\*2) [Goldwasser, S., Micali, S., Rackoff, C.: "The knowledge complexity
            of interactive proof-systems," STOC 1985.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/22145.22178)



            The claims that can be proven with zero-knowledge proof are knowledge
            about propositions. A proposition is a verbal expression of a judgment
            that is clearly true or false (\*3).


            - (\*3)

            For example, "2023 is equal to 7×17×17" is a proposition, and it is a
            true fact. "I know the prime factorization of 2023" is knowledge related
            to the stated proposition and is an example of a claim that can be used
            for zero-knowledge proof. On the other hand, "2023 is a large number"
            is subjective and not a proposition. Therefore, the claim that "I know
            2023 is a big number" is not a subject of zero-knowledge proof.



            In general, a zero-knowledge proof must satisfy three properties: completeness,
            soundness, and zero-knowledge (Table 1).


            | Nature | Overview |

            | --- | --- |

            | Completeness | If the prover is correct, it will be determined to be
            correct by the verifier |

            | Soundness | If the prover is incorrect, it must be determined to be
            incorrect by the verifier with a high probability |

            | Zero-Knowledge | The verifier cannot obtain any knowledge other than
            the fact that the prover wants to prove |


            Table 1: Requirements for a zero-knowledge proof


            ## Intuitive understanding of Zero-Knowledge Proofs


            Here are two examples to help you understand zero-knowledge proofs intuitively.


            ### 1\. The cave problem


            This explanation was introduced in the paper "How to explain zero-knowledge
            protocols to your children" (\*4).


            - (\*4) [Jean-Jacques Quisquater et al., "How to Explain Zero-Knowledge
            Protocols to Your Children," CRYPTO 1989. (PDF: 227KB)](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~mkowalcz/628.pdf)


            Inside the cave is a magic door that opens when you say the password.
            The prover P knows the password and gives it in exchange for money. The
            door is at the far end of the cave shown in Figure 2. There are two paths
            to the door, A and B. The person who knows the password can open the door
            and move from A to B or vice versa.


            ![](https://nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img02.jpg?h=453&iar=0&w=800&rev=cf4c7228935441d3b38f0fd9442af117)


            Figure 2: The Cave Problem



            V, the verifier, wants to buy the password, but he doubts whether P really
            knows the password and cannot start a transaction. If P can convince V
            that P knows the secret password without telling V the secret password
            itself, V can start a transaction. So, here''s what they are trying to
            do.


            First, V waits outside the cave. Then P enters the cave, randomly chooses
            either path A or B, and goes to the door (Figure 3).


            ![](https://nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img03.jpg?h=533&iar=0&w=800&rev=0918e3fa17984bbe8d735ff3c9df3166)


            Figure 3: Prover P''s Random Selection



            Next, V enters the cave, goes to the branching point of the paths, randomly
            chooses A or B in their head, and shouts to P to come out from the chosen
            path (Figure 4).


            ![](https://nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img04.jpg?h=401&iar=0&w=800&rev=945bfc0651e54daea0b604e2edd6f2a4)


            Figure 4: Verifier V''s Random Selection



            If P knows the password:


            P can use the password to open the door and come out of the designated
            path, whichever way V tells him to go (Figure 5). This means completeness.


            ![](https://nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img05.jpg?h=466&iar=0&w=800&rev=6088ed6bec1c4fd3a3ac05b15c69a53a)


            Figure 5: The Case that Prover P Knows the Password



            If P does not know the password:


            P can only come out of the path he entered, so the probability of coming
            out of the path chosen by V is 50%. If they repeat this process over and
            over again, it''s almost impossible for P to fool V every time (Figure
            6). For example, if they try 30 times, the probability that P can fool
            V is about 0.0000001%. This means soundness.


            ![](https://nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img06.jpg?h=421&iar=0&w=800&rev=db7f0b94506a47679157cddc1b1a33bf)


            Figure 6: The Case that Prover P Does Not Know the Password



            So, if P succeeds on all his attempts, V must be convinced that P knows
            the password. If V tries even more, he can get his chance of being cheated
            as close to 0% as V wants. At this time, V will not gain any knowledge
            about the password. This means zero-knowledge.


            Literally, what P wants to prove has been proved to V with zero-knowledge.


            ### 2\. The Problem of Finding a Seabird


            Professor Amit Sahai of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)
            explains the concept of zero-knowledge proof on YouTube to children, teenagers,
            college students, graduate students, and experts in five different difficulty
            levels (\*5). Here is a child-friendly explanations that will help you
            get a sense of the main points.


            - (\*5) [Computer Scientist Explains One Concept in 5 Levels of Difficulty,
            WIRED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOGdb1CTu5c)


            The professor shows the child a picture. The picture shows a crowd of
            hundreds of penguins. He says, "There is one puffin (a penguin-like seabird),
            and I know where it is, but I don''t want to tell you. Do you believe
            me? I''m going to prove it without revealing its location."


            ![](https://nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img07.jpg?h=505&iar=0&w=800&rev=3f05fc0c1f934735a75fbbae8353800f)


            Figure 7: The Problem of Finding a Seabird



            The professor pulls out a piece of black paper several times larger than
            the photo. The paper has a small hole, and the photo is pasted on the
            back of the paper so that the hole matches the position of the puffin.
            The child looks into the hole and says, "I see a puffin". But the child
            can''t see the position of the photo on the back of the paper, so she
            can''t tell where the puffin is in the original photo. "This is an example
            of a zero-knowledge proof," the professor explains (Figure 8).


            ![](https://nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img08.jpg?h=370&iar=0&w=800&rev=46de5598e3f64c609c0c7fd1a156c661)


            Figure 8: Zero-Knowledge Proof for the Problem of Finding a Seabird



            This exchange satisfies completeness because a professor who knows the
            location of the puffin can always prove it.


            Furthermore, it satisfies soundness because if the professor does not
            know the location of the puffin, the cheating will be exposed with a high
            probability if the child looks into the hole and confirms it.


            Furthermore, it satisfies zero-knowledge because the child cannot obtain
            any knowledge other than the fact that the professor knows the location
            of the puffin.


            ## Social Application Examples


            This paper introduces an application example of zero-knowledge proof to
            society and considers prospects.


            ### 1\. Blockchain Privacy Enhancement


            Blockchain is widely used in society, a representative example being virtual
            currencies. Its transparency is maintained by decentralized management
            of its ledger by all participants in the blockchain. However, due to its
            high transparency, securing user privacy may be a challenge.


            In recent years, zero-knowledge proofs have begun to be used to improve
            blockchain privacy. For example, in the case of cryptocurrencies, methods
            known collectively as zk-SNARK (\*6) and zk-STARK (\*7) have begun to
            be introduced as zero-knowledge proofs to show that the transaction operation
            was indeed performed, without disclosing the transaction contents such
            as the sender, recipient, and remittance amount.


            In addition, zero-knowledge proofs have attracted even more attention
            because they can contribute to speeding up blockchain processing.

            - (\*7)

            zk-STARK: Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge



            ### 2\. Proof of Income Range


            In November 2017, ING, a major Dutch bank, developed zero-knowledge range
            proofs (ZKRP) (\*8). ZKRP is an application of zero-knowledge proofs.
            ZKRP can prove that a numerical value, such as an amount of money, is
            within a certain range without showing the numerical value to the other
            party. For example, mortgage applicants can prove that their income is
            within a certain range required by loan screening without telling the
            income itself.


            - (\*8)[ING launches Zero-Knowledge Range Proof solution, a major addition
            to blockchain technology](https://www.ingwb.com/en/insights/distributed-ledger-technology/ing-launches-major-addition-to-blockchain-technology)


            ### 3\. Selective Disclosure of Attribute Information


            The W3C, which standardizes Web technologies, has standardized a data
            model for the concept of verifiable credentials (VC) (\*9). It introduces
            zero-knowledge proof, in which you select your attribute information and
            prove only that the attribute satisfies certain conditions.


            For example, it shows a use case in which you select and prove only the
            information that a university graduate received a degree without revealing
            his or her identity or other unnecessary personal information.


            - (\*9) [W3C Recommendation, Verifiable Credentials Data Model v1.1, 2022.](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#zero-knowledge-proofs)



            VC is currently being discussed in the "Trusted Web" initiative led by
            the Cabinet Secretariat of Japan. It shows the expectation of zero-knowledge
            proof as a method to realize selective disclosure of data(\*10).


            - (\*10) [Secretariat of the Headquarters for Digital Market Competition,
            the Cabinet Secretariat of Japan, "Trusted Web White Paper Ver 2.0, Overview"
            August 2022 (PDF: 1.7MB)](https://www.kantei.go.jp/jp/singi/digitalmarket/pdf_e/Trusted_Web_White_Paper_ver2.0_Overview.pdf)


            ### 4\. User Authentication


            Currently, ID and password authentication is mainly used for websites
            of various services. However, since the string length of a password is
            limited to a range that can be remembered or managed by the human brain,
            it is vulnerable to brute-force and password-list-type attacks.


            Furthermore, if an attacker takes over the server, not only the password
            itself, but also information useful for guessing the password is leaked,
            which becomes a hint for the attacker, and the password may be leaked
            in the future. If user authentication is implemented with zero-knowledge
            proof, the server can be more secure because no information related to
            the password exists from the beginning.


            As a zero-knowledge proof that can be applied to user authentication,
            there is the Schnorr protocol (\*11). In this method, knowledge about
            the solution of a mathematically difficult problem called the discrete
            logarithm problem is assumed to be information that only the user can
            know and is authenticated with zero-knowledge proof. Compared with the
            ID and password method, this method has not been adopted in the world
            for many years due to its disadvantages such as high communication volume,
            slow processing speed, and "The size of the data to be kept secret is
            too large for humans to remember."


            - (\*11) [IETF, RFC 8235, Schnorr Non-interactive Zero-Knowledge Proof,
            September 2017](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8235)


            In recent years, however, with the spread of technologies such as "faster
            communication networks," "faster processing speeds of servers and terminals,"
            and "memory areas that can be securely stored in smart cards and smartphones,"
            conventional disadvantages are going to be no longer disadvantages.


            ## Prospect


            In recent years, the term "Web3" has attracted attention, and although
            there are various interpretations, its constituent concepts are said to
            be centered on "blockchain," "decentralization" and "decentralized ID."
            Application cases (1) and (2) mentioned above are measures to improve
            the privacy of blockchain, and (3) and (4) are related to decentralization
            and decentralized ID. Therefore, zero-knowledge proof can be said to be
            "a technology that brings trustworthiness to the privacy of Web3."


            In the future, zero-knowledge proof will become an essential technology
            for safe and secure future societies that require a high level of privacy.


            NTT DATA will continue to keep up with the latest trends and accumulate
            and disclose know-hows.

            \ growth and technological innovations, however our most sensitive and\
            \ private information has necessarily come along for the ride. This puts\
            \ individuals, private organizations, and governments increasingly at\
            \ risk of becoming victims of data breaches and hacks.\n\nSolutions to\
            \ these problems often call for increased know your customer practices\
            \ (KYC) and reporting. KYC is a regulatory and security process where\
            \ businesses verify the identity of their clients to prevent identity\
            \ theft, financial fraud, money laundering, and terrorist financing. While\
            \ there are benefits to this approach, it comes with the risk of sensitive\
            \ data being distributed to even more parties, thus increasing the potential\
            \ surface area for attack, and further reducing individual privacy. In\
            \ a world where trust in institutions is historically low, this can be\
            \ a hard pill for individuals to swallow. But what if there was a solution\
            \ that allowed individuals, private organizations, and governments alike\
            \ to verify things like identity and financial data with said data always\
            \ remaining encrypted and obfuscated? What if you didn’t have to trust\
            \ because instead, you could verify?\n\nZero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) have\
            \ emerged as a pivotal cryptographic innovation representing a paradigm\
            \ shift replacing the need to trust with the ability to _verify_. This\
            \ comprehensive exploration will shed light on how ZKPs are reshaping\
            \ privacy and security paradigms across various sectors. By the end of\
            \ this article, policymakers will have gained a nuanced understanding\
            \ of ZKPs' potential to improve security while maintaining privacy across\
            \ a wide range of use cases and why they are indispensable in today’s\
            \ digital ecosystem.\n\n## An Idea Ahead of Its Time\n\nFirst described\
            \ in a [1985 MIT paper](https://people.csail.mit.edu/silvio/Selected%20Scientific%20Papers/Proof%20Systems/The_Knowledge_Complexity_Of_Interactive_Proof_Systems.pdf),\
            \ zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) have been an idea simmering on the back\
            \ burner of cryptographic research for decades. Although conceptually\
            \ sound, the technology required for large-scale and cost-effective deployment\
            \ was not yet available. However, with recent advancements in computational\
            \ power and the advent of blockchain technology, ZKPs are now coming to\
            \ the forefront.\n\nThe feasibility of ZKP applications now being able\
            \ to be deployed at scale can be attributed primarily to two key developments:\n\
            \n1. **Advancements in Computational Power:** Historically, ZKPs were\
            \ computationally intensive, requiring significant processing power which\
            \ limited their practicality. The exponential growth in computational\
            \ capabilities, in particular, more efficient processors and the widespread\
            \ availability of cloud computing, has made it feasible to perform complex\
            \ ZKP computations quickly and cost-effectively.\n\n2. **Synergies with\
            \ Blockchain Technology:** The cryptographic nature of ZKPs aligns seamlessly\
            \ with blockchain technologies. Blockchain's inherent characteristics\
            \ of decentralization, immutability, and transparency provide a conducive\
            \ environment for ZKP applications. Several blockchain platforms have\
            \ integrated ZKPs as a core component of their technology stack, fostering\
            \ ready-built platforms for the development and deployment of ZKP-based\
            \ applications.\n\n\nThese technological advancements have transformed\
            \ ZKPs from a theoretical concept into a practical tool, unlocking their\
            \ potential to enhance privacy and security in an increasingly digital\
            \ world.\n\n## How Do Zero-Knowledge Proofs Work?\n\nIn a zero-knowledge\
            \ proof, there are two parties: a prover and a verifier. In this transaction,\
            \ the prover can assure a verifier of the truthfulness of a particular\
            \ assertion regarding a data point without revealing any extra details\
            \ about the corresponding data.\n\nZKPs can be categorized into two types:\n\
            \n- **Interactive**, where the prover must engage in the verification\
            \ process anew for each distinct verifier.\n\n- **Non-interactiv** e,\
            \ where the prover creates a universally verifiable proof.\n\n\nThe three\
            \ key characteristics that encapsulate a ZKP are:\n\n- **Completeness**:\
            \ For any true statement, a credible prover can successfully persuade\
            \ an honest verifier of their knowledge about the accurate input.\n\n\
            - **Soundness:** In the case of a false statement, no deceitful prover\
            \ can independently convince an honest verifier of their knowledge about\
            \ the accurate input.\n\n- **Zero-Knowledge**: When the statement is true,\
            \ the verifier gains no additional information from the prover beyond\
            \ the fact that the statement is indeed true.\n\n\nThe math that makes\
            \ this possible is beyond the scope of this piece, however, a simple example\
            \ can help conceptualize how a ZKP works.\n\nImagine you have a \"Where's\
            \ Waldo?\" book, and you claim to know exactly where Waldo is on a particular\
            \ page. Your friend, however, is skeptical and wants proof of your claim.\
            \ But here's the challenge: you need to prove you know where Waldo is\
            \ without pointing him out directly, thus keeping his location a secret.\n\
            \n![A photo in sepia of a crowd with a man wearing glasses and a red and\
            \ white stripped sweater and had in color. ](https://5g.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/styles/fullbleed_image/public/media/uploads/images/8560929002_bd81ba6679_o.jpg)\n\

            \nHere's how you can do it: \"Where's Waldo?\"\n\n1. **The Challenge:**\
            \ You open the \"Where's Waldo?\" book to the page in question and show\
            \ it to your friend.\n\n2. **The Proof Technique:** To prove your knowledge\
            \ without revealing Waldo's location, you take a large piece of cardboard\
            \ with a small hole cut in it.\n\n3. **The Verification:** You place the\
            \ cardboard over the page so that the hole reveals Waldo, but nothing\
            \ else on the page is visible. Your friend can now see Waldo through the\
            \ hole, confirming you know his location.\n\n4. **Maintaining Secrecy:**\
            \ Despite verifying your claim, your friend still doesn't know where on\
            \ the page Waldo is. The rest of the page is covered, keeping the information\
            \ hidden.\n\n\nIn this scenario:\n\n- **Completeness:** If you truly know\
            \ where Waldo is, you can easily align the hole in the cardboard to reveal\
            \ him, convincing your friend of your knowledge.\n\n- **Soundness:** If\
            \ you don’t actually know where Waldo is, you won’t be able to align the\
            \ hole correctly, and your friend won’t be convinced of your claim.\n\n\
            - **Zero-Knowledge:** Despite proving you know Waldo’s location, you haven’t\
            \ revealed any additional information about where on the page Waldo is.\n\
            \n\nThese proofs enable one party to prove the validity of a statement\
            \ to another without revealing any underlying information. In an era where\
            \ data breaches are rampant, ZKPs offer hope for secure and private online\
            \ interactions.\n\n## A Myriad of Real-World and Digital-World Applications\n\
            \nZKPs have a wide array of applications, each demonstrating their versatility\
            \ and importance in enhancing privacy and security in various digital\
            \ domains:\n\n### Decentralized Identity and Authentication:\n\nZKPs can\
            \ serve as a foundational technology for identity management systems by\
            \ offering a dual advantage: they enable robust identity verification\
            \ while safeguarding personal information. This is particularly relevant\
            \ in systems built on blockchains, which are inherently global and interoperable,\
            \ facilitating secure international information sharing.\n\n- **Offline\
            \ Applications:** ZKPs can be used in everyday situations like confirming\
            \ age for alcohol purchase or even verifying citizenship and non-sanctioned\
            \ status at international borders. In these cases, ZKPs provide proof\
            \ of specific personal attributes without revealing any additional personal\
            \ information.\n\n- **Online Applications:** The decentralized nature\
            \ of blockchain networks limits traditional KYC practices, but ZKPs offer\
            \ a way for central entities to securely verify user identities.\n\n\n\
            Since it is one of the most impactful applications of ZKPs, the following\
            \ section takes a deep dive into decentralized identity.\n\n### Voting\
            \ Systems:\n\nZKPs introduce a new paradigm in voting systems, particularly\
            \ in conjunction with distributed ledger technologies. Together, they\
            \ enable a voting process that is both anonymous and verifiable, enhancing\
            \ the integrity and transparency of elections.\n\n- **Identity Verification\
            \ and Eligibility Checks:** Leveraging the decentralized identity solutions\
            \ discussed earlier, ZKPs can be used to verify a voter's identity and\
            \ their eligibility to vote. This approach ensures that only qualified\
            \ individuals participate in the voting process and that no one can vote\
            \ more than once. Such identity verification acts as a gatekeeper to access\
            \ existing voting systems, upholding the principle that every vote counts\
            \ and should be counted correctly.\n\n- **Anonymous Verifiable Voting:**\
            \ Beyond verifying voter identity, ZKPs can preserve the anonymity of\
            \ the voting process. Voters can confidently validate their eligibility\
            \ and cast their ballots without having to reveal their identities or\
            \ the specifics of their vote. This application of ZKPs allows each vote\
            \ to remain confidential while ensuring the entire voting process is transparent\
            \ and auditable.\n\n- **Auditable Yet Private Voting System:** The integration\
            \ of ZKPs in voting systems is transformative, enhancing both the verification\
            \ mechanism and the voting process itself. By incorporating ZKPs, the\
            \ system not only links each vote to an eligible voter but also maintains\
            \ voter anonymity. This dual capability creates a voting environment that\
            \ is secure, transparent, and respectful of voter privacy. The system\
            \ can be implemented either as an identity check before accessing existing\
            \ voting platforms or as an integral part of a new blockchain-based voting\
            \ system, embedding both identity verification and vote casting within\
            \ a unified, secure framework.\n\n\n### AI and Machine Learning:\n\n-\
            \ Privacy Preservation in Data Usage:\n  - A key challenge in AI and machine\
            \ learning is accessing large datasets for training models without compromising\
            \ sensitive information contained within the data. ZKPs enable the verification\
            \ of data authenticity and integrity for these models while keeping the\
            \ underlying data elements private.\n\n  - The capability to verify information\
            \ while maintain privacy is particularly crucial in industries like healthcare\
            \ or finance, where data confidentiality is paramount. ZKPs allow for\
            \ the utilization of detailed datasets for model training without exposing\
            \ individual data points, thus upholding privacy standards and regulatory\
            \ compliance.\n- Blockchain Integration for Model Accountability:\n  -\
            \ Combining ZKPs with blockchain technology introduces a new level of\
            \ transparency and accountability in AI and machine learning. Blockchain\
            \ provides an immutable record of transactions which enables the tracking\
            \ of data changes, model updates, and decision-making processes when applied\
            \ to AI models.\n\n  - This integration allows for a transparent audit\
            \ trail of how AI models evolve over time and how data influences these\
            \ models. It addresses concerns around model integrity and reliability,\
            \ ensuring that changes or updates to AI systems are transparent and accountable.\n\
            - Enhancing Trust in AI Systems:\n  - By utilizing ZKPs, AI and machine\
            \ learning systems can demonstrate that they function as intended without\
            \ revealing their internal workings or the proprietary data they process.\
            \ This builds trust among users and stakeholders, assuring them that the\
            \ AI systems are not only effective but also respect privacy and data\
            \ security.\n\n  - In scenarios where decisions made by AI systems need\
            \ to be justified or explained, such as in credit scoring or medical diagnostics,\
            \ the combination of ZKPs and blockchain can provide necessary assurances\
            \ about the data and processes used without compromising sensitive information.\n\
            - Facilitating Collaborative AI Development:\n  - ZKPs enable multiple\
            \ parties to contribute data to AI models securely and privately. This\
            \ collaborative approach, bolstered by the trust mechanisms of ZKPs and\
            \ blockchain, can accelerate AI innovation by allowing diverse data sources\
            \ to be used collectively, broadening the scope and applicability of AI\
            \ solutions.\n\n### Privacy on Public Blockchains:\n\n- The immutable\
            \ and public nature of data stored on a blockchain is a defining and often\
            \ beneficial feature, this feature can become an issue in transactions\
            \ that require privacy. For more on the challenges and opportunities presented\
            \ by the transparent nature of public blockchains, check out our previous\
            \ [Blockchain Brief on blockchain privacy.](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/blockchain-worlds-least-private-diary)\n\
            \  - **Private Transactions:** ZKPs are used in blockchains for privacy-preserving\
            \ transactions that keep details like monetary amounts and participant\
            \ identities private.  ZKPs can keep this information private while verifying\
            \ that users are not participating in illicit activity or transacting\
            \ with sanctioned entities.\n\n  - **Private Exchange and Settlement of\
            \ Digital Assets:** ZKPs ensure the privacy of transactions and participants\
            \ during the exchange of digital tokens, such as equity tokens. This is\
            \ crucial for both centralized and decentralized exchanges, allowing for\
            \ efficient and private asset settlement. As more real-world assets (RWAs)\
            \ like real estate and high-valuable collectibles are tokenized and more\
            \ transactions involving RWAs are conducted on-chain, this efficiency\
            \ and privacy is paramount.\n\n### Scalable Ethereum Layer 2 Rollups:\n\
            \nZKPs, through methods like zero-knowledge rollups (ZK-rollups), are\
            \ highly secure and scalable Layer 2 solutions on Ethereum that facilitate\
            \ faster, more efficient transactions. If you need a refresher on the\
            \ difference between a Layer 1 and Layer 2 blockchain before we dive deeper\
            \ into the current state of ZK rollups, be sure to check out our previous\
            \ [Blockchain Brief where we break it down.](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/understanding-ethereums-layer-1-and-layer-2-differences-adoption-and-drawbacks)\n\
            \n### Oracle-Enhanced Verifiable Computations:\n\n- In decentralized oracle\
            \ networks, ZKPs can be leveraged for verifiable computations related\
            \ to off-chain data points. [As explained in a previous Blockchain Brief](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/delphi-defi-how-crypto-oracles-are-shaping-future-finance),\
            \ blockchain oracles provide smart contracts with access to external data\
            \ and computation results. Using ZKPs in this context ensures the integrity\
            \ and confidentiality of the data processed by the oracles. Relevant off-chain\
            \ data points include:Financial Data: Verifying stock prices or foreign\
            \ exchange rates for use in smart contracts without revealing sensitive\
            \ market data.\n\n- Supply Chain Information: Confirming the authenticity\
            \ of supply chain events like product manufacturing or shipping status\
            \ without disclosing proprietary details.\n\n- Real-World Events: Maintaining\
            \ data privacy while validating outcomes of real-world events, like sports\
            \ results and election outcomes, that impact contract executions Weather\
            \ Data: Securely integrating weather information for agriculture-related\
            \ smart contracts without full data exposure.\n\n\n### Internet of Things\
            \ (IoT):\n\n- Securing IoT device communications and reducing data transmission\
            \ through ZKPs enhances both privacy and efficiency in interconnected\
            \ devices.\n\n\n### Supply Chains:\n\n- ZKPs can authenticate compliance\
            \ and origin in supply chain management without revealing sensitive data,\
            \ which is crucial for businesses that wish to keep supplier information\
            \ confidential.\n\n\nThese diverse applications across sectors underscores\
            \ the significance of ZKPs in addressing privacy and security challenges\
            \ in the digital age by offering robust solutions for secure, private,\
            \ and efficient digital interactions.\n\n## A Deeper Dive into Decentralized\
            \ Digital Identity and Securing Personal Identifiable Information\n\n\
            Zero-knowledge proofs present a unique solution to address the urgent\
            \ need for safe and secure methods of digital identity verification and\
            \ storage of personal identifiable information (PII). ZPKs minimize the\
            \ exposure of PII by enabling the verification of essential information\
            \ while keeping other personal details hidden, thereby fortifying systems\
            \ against data breaches and preserving individual privacy. This is crucial\
            \ in scenarios ranging from social media interactions to financial transactions.\n\
            \nConsider the routine action of showing an ID to purchase alcohol – you\
            \ inadvertently expose more information than necessary.\n\nThe cashier\
            \ only needs to verify two things: that the id is a valid, government\
            \ issued id and that you are 21 or older. Yet you are revealing your full\
            \ name, home address, birthdate and age, sex, height, weight, eye color,\
            \ and driver’s license number. These pieces of information are individually\
            \ harmless, but when they are used together, there is potential for abuse,\
            \ not to mention a violation of an individual’s right to privacy.\n\n\
            This scenario is amplified online, where the sharing of social security\
            \ numbers, financial details, and personal activities often leads to privacy\
            \ invasion and increases the risk of cyberattacks. Consider the following\
            \ three examples representing massive misuse and exposure of sensitive\
            \ user data, and how Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) could have potentially\
            \ mitigated these incidents:\n\n1\\. Cambridge Analytica Scandal:\n\n\
            - **Real-World Incident:** A third-party app, This Is Your Digital Life,\
            \ allowed unauthorized collection of personal data from millions of Facebook\
            \ users. Cambridge Analytica used that data for political advertising,\
            \ including in the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign. This breach\
            \ raised significant concerns about privacy and the influence of social\
            \ media on politics.\n\n- **ZKP Mitigation:** ZKPs could have been used\
            \ to verify the specific user attributes (e.g., age, location, political\
            \ interests) necessary for academic research or targeted advertising without\
            \ revealing or transferring the underlying data. That way, Facebook could\
            \ confirm specific demographics of its user base to third parties without\
            \ exposing individual user data.\n\n\n2\\.  T-Mobile Data Breaches:\n\n\
            - **Real-World Incident:** Caused by a misconfigured API, T-Mobile experienced\
            \ a data breach that exposed the personal data of 37 million customers.\
            \ The stolen data was used by cybercriminals for sophisticated phishing,\
            \ vishing, and smishing attacks.\n\n- **ZKP Mitigation:** ZKPs could have\
            \ been employed in T-Mobile’s data handling processes to validate user\
            \ identity and credentials without exposing user data. For instance, a\
            \ customer service application could verify that a person is a T-Mobile\
            \ customer and check their plan details without the API accessing the\
            \ full range of personal information stored in the database.\n\n\n3\\\
            . Equifax Data Breach of 2017:\n\n- **Real-World Incident:** This breach,\
            \ one of the largest in U.S. history, compromised the personal information\
            \ of about 147.9 million Americans, as well as millions of British and\
            \ Canadian citizens. Hackers accessed names, Social Security numbers,\
            \ birth dates, addresses, and in some cases, driver's license numbers.\
            \ The breach was deemed \"entirely preventable\" by the House Committee\
            \ on Oversight.\n\n- **ZKP Mitigation:** If ZKPs had been used, Equifax\
            \ could have allowed third-party services to confirm individuals' creditworthiness\
            \ or identity without accessing detailed personal data like Social Security\
            \ numbers or birth dates. For example, a lender could verify if a person's\
            \ credit score falls within a specific range without Equifax needing to\
            \ share the actual credit report.\n\n\nIn each of these scenarios, ZKPs\
            \ would have offered a way to validate and prove necessary information\
            \ without exposing data, thus significantly reducing the risk of data\
            \ breaches and misuse of personal information. Implementing ZKPs requires\
            \ rethinking how systems interact with personal data and moving towards\
            \ a model where verification is possible without data exposure. The adoption\
            \ of ZKPs benefits individuals whose personal data remains protected and\
            \ private as well as businesses, which can avoid the substantial financial\
            \ and reputational damage often associated with such data breaches. By\
            \ enhancing data security and integrity, ZKPs provide two key benefits:\
            \ they help in building trust among consumers and simultaneously safeguard\
            \ businesses against the risks and liabilities of data mismanagement.\n\
            \n## The Current State of ZK-Rollups\n\nAs noted earlier, the two developments\
            \ that have allowed ZKPs to finally transition from academic concept to\
            \ real world use have been increased power and availability of compute\
            \ and blockchains. While smart contract platforms like Solana and Avalanche\
            \ have seen significant growth in daily active users, ecosystem development,\
            \ and capital inflows in 2023, Ethereum and its Layer 2 blockchains remain\
            \ the dominant smart contract ecosystem. As of 1/17/24, Ethereum and its\
            \ L2 chains have a combined market cap ($322B) 1.6X higher than [every\
            \ other smart contract platform combined](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/smart-contract-platform)\
            \ and 72% ($78B) of [total value locked](https://defillama.com/chains)\
            \ (TVL) in [decentralized finance (DeFi)](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/defi-101-good-bad-and-regulatory).\n\
            \nAs discussed in our previous article, breaking down the difference between\
            \ [L1 and L2 Ethereum](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/understanding-ethereums-layer-1-and-layer-2-differences-adoption-and-drawbacks),\
            \ L2 blockchains are pivotal in enabling Ethereum to scale. As a quick\
            \ refresher, there are two types of rollups: Optimistic rollups and ZK\
            \ rollups. While ZK rollups are broadly considered the superior technology,\
            \ the increased complexity of ZKP development, higher compute requirements,\
            \ and layer 1 technological limitations have given optimistic rollups\
            \ a strong first mover advantage. The top three optimistic rollups, [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.foundation/),\
            \ [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/), and [Base](https://www.base.org/),\
            \ currently hold 81% of the total L2 market share.\n\nThe tide has begun\
            \ to change, as several notable ZK-rollups went live in 2023. As of 2024,\
            \ the development and implementation of ZK-rollups on Ethereum have advanced\
            \ significantly, showing promising growth and innovation in various projects.\n\
            \nYou can find a list of notable Optimistic and ZK-rollups in the previous\
            \ Blockchain Brief, [Understanding Ethereum's Layer 1 and Layer 2](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/understanding-ethereums-layer-1-and-layer-2-differences-adoption-and-drawbacks).\n\
            \nWhile optimistic rollups collectively represent the majority of L2 activity\
            \ and TVL, ZK-rollups are quickly picking up steam and are expected to\
            \ overtake their optimistic cousins. Notably, over the last 30 days, [zkSync\
            \ Era](https://zksync.io/) has processed more transactions than Arbitrum,\
            \ Optimism, Base, and Ethereum Mainnet. Both Arbitrum and Optimism have\
            \ both stated they expect to transition their respective chains to ZK-rollups\
            \ eventually.\n\nThe key takeaway here is that the myriad of real-world\
            \ use cases enabled by ZKPs requires a compatible blockchain. That compatibility\
            \ now exists with the advent of ZK-rollups. This, in conjunction with\
            \ the upcoming [Dencun upgrade](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/10/27/ethereums-dencun-upgrade-is-a-step-toward-a-scalable-settlement-layer-goldman-sachs/)\
            \ to Ethereum set to launch in the coming months (currently live on testnet\
            \ as of 1/17/24), which will dramatically decrease transaction costs for\
            \ L2s while bringing enhanced security, will not only allow all of these\
            \ use cases to deploy but also allow them to do so cost-effectively at\
            \ scale.\n\n## Why Policymakers Should Pay Attention\n\nWe live in an\
            \ increasingly digital world. As individuals, private organizations, and\
            \ governments move more of their interactions online, ever more of our\
            \ most sensitive data is put at risk of data breaches and hacks. At a\
            \ time when faith in public institutions is at an [all time low](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/09/19/public-trust-in-government-1958-2023/)\
            \ and global ransomware attacks are predicted to [exceed $265B by 2031](https://cybersecurityventures.com/global-ransomware-damage-costs-predicted-to-reach-250-billion-usd-by-2031/),\
            \ the need for technologies like ZKPs to restore faith in the integrity\
            \ of elections, bolster online security, and protect an individual's right\
            \ to privacy is abundantly clear.\n\nThere are many applications of ZKPs\
            \ that can help balance privacy, security, and regulatory compliance.\
            \ This is especially relevant in the context of global and interoperable\
            \ blockchain technology, where ZKPs can bolster blockchains ability to\
            \ enhance the resilience and accessibility of critical infrastructure\
            \ and international cooperation.\n\n### Challenges in the US Regulatory\
            \ Environment\n\nThe US’s ambiguous regulatory environment is currently\
            \ driving blockchain and ZKP-based technology development overseas. A\
            \ lack of clear guidelines is causing a brain drain in this sector, with\
            \ developers and companies opting for more predictable and supportive\
            \ environments in countries like Japan, Singapore, and parts of the EU.\
            \ This regulatory uncertainty is particularly impactful in the area of\
            \ decentralized finance (DeFi), where traditional frameworks struggle\
            \ to adapt to the novel nature of blockchain technologies.\n\n### ZKPs:\
            \ A Potential Solution to DeFi KYC\n\nWithin this challenging regulatory\
            \ landscape, the proposed digital assets tax reporting regulations in\
            \ the bipartisan infrastructure bill have defined decentralized entities\
            \ as brokers. This definition is incompatible with the decentralized nature\
            \ of these entities' protocols, as many lack a central entity capable\
            \ of conducting traditional Know Your Customer (KYC) practices. The significant\
            \ compliance and cost burden for startups could drive talent offshore,\
            \ potentially cutting off US users from innovative products. Furthermore,\
            \ the decentralized structure of these platforms allows users bypass front-end\
            \ data collection and access the backend directly.\n\nZero-Knowledge Proofs\
            \ (ZKPs) emerge as a feasible solution in this context. They enable the\
            \ verification of essential information and reporting through smart contracts,\
            \ all without the need to store sensitive data. By using ZKPs, compliance\
            \ with regulations can be achieved while maintaining a balance between\
            \ privacy, security, and innovation. This technology not only minimizes\
            \ the risk of spreading sensitive data across multiple parties but also\
            \ alleviates the compliance burden for emerging companies. In turn, this\
            \ fosters a healthier environment for technological advancement in the\
            \ US, particularly in the burgeoning field of DeFi.\n\n## Conclusion:\
            \ A Call to Action for Policymakers\n\nAs we navigate the complexities\
            \ of the digital age, Zero-Knowledge Proofs emerge as a powerful tool\
            \ in preserving privacy while ensuring security. Policymakers face the\
            \ challenge of fostering an environment that supports the growth and application\
            \ of ZKPs while protecting consumer rights and privacy. Regulations should\
            \ be forward-thinking, adaptable, and balanced to encourage innovation\
            \ in this space. The harmonious blend of privacy and security that ZKPs\
            \ provide is not just a technological advancement but a step towards a\
            \ more secure and equitable digital world.\n\nIn conclusion, the potential\
            \ of ZKPs is vast and multifaceted. From securing online transactions\
            \ to safeguarding AI and machine learning models, they offer a solution\
            \ that strikes a balance between privacy and security. As machine learning\
            \ continues to evolve and our digital footprints expand, the role of ZKPs\
            \ in protecting our digital identities is critical. It is imperative for\
            \ policymakers to understand these dynamics and create a regulatory environment\
            \ that nurtures innovation, protects consumers, and maintains the integrity\
            \ of the financial system. By embracing the possibilities of Zero-Knowledge\
            \ Proofs, we can pave the way for a more secure, private, and equitable\
            \ digital future.\n\n- [Science and Technology](https://5g.wilsoncenter.org/issue/science-and-technology)\n\

            # Top Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Proof Crypto Projects of 2025


            Intermediate


            Last Update April 2, 2025


            ![Top Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Proof Crypto Projects of 2025](https://assets.staticimg.com/reaper-image/663ca291b16963000196221a_Top%20Zero-Knowledge%20%28ZK%29%20Proof%20Crypto%20Projects%20of%202024-16-9.jpg)


            Zero-knowledge proofs are cryptographic methods that enable one party
            to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any information
            beyond the validity of the statement itself. Here’s a look at some of
            the best zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) crypto projects in the market.


            Imagine being able to prove you know a secret without ever having to reveal
            it. This is the essence of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), a revolutionary
            concept in the blockchain and crypto landscape that enhances privacy and
            scalability. As we delve deeper into 2024, ZKPs are increasingly crucial
            due to their ability to execute transactions or prove knowledge without
            exposing any underlying data.


            Zero-knowledge proofs have been gaining traction for their role in addressing
            the dual challenges of privacy and scalability in blockchain technologies.
            They are particularly significant in an era where digital privacy concerns
            are peaking, and the demand for efficient, scalable blockchain solutions
            is critical. Their growing application across various crypto projects
            in 2024 underlines their potential to reshape the blockchain ecosystem.


            ## What Are Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)?


            Zero-knowledge proofs allow a "prover" to convince a "verifier" that they
            know a value or that a statement is true without revealing any information
            beyond the statement''s validity. This process hinges on three critical
            properties:


            - **Completeness:** If the prover''s statement is true, the verifier will
            be convinced by the proof without any doubt.


            - **Soundness:** If the statement is false, no cheating prover can convince
            the verifier of its truthfulness, except with negligible probability.


            - **Zero-Knowledge:** The verifier learns nothing other than the fact
            that the statement is true, gaining no further information from the proof.



            The benefits of using ZKPs in cryptocurrency projects are manifold. They
            enhance privacy by enabling transactions where no sensitive information
            is disclosed. For example, in voting systems, they can confirm a user''s
            eligibility without revealing their identity. They also improve scalability
            through constructions like [zk-Rollups](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/crypto/top-ethereum-zk-rollup-projects),
            where transaction data is processed off-chain and only the validity proof
            is stored on the blockchain, thereby reducing the data load and speeding
            up transaction times.


            Consider the often-cited "Ali Baba cave" analogy for a more interactive
            understanding. Here, a person proves they know the secret to opening a
            hidden door inside a cave without revealing the secret itself. They do
            this by performing actions that are observable (like emerging from the
            correct door), but the secret phrase itself is never disclosed.


            This concept is not just theoretical; it''s already being implemented
            in significant projects for secure transactions, identity verification,
            and more, all without compromising the privacy of any party involved.


            **Here’s a deep dive into [zero-knowledge proof (ZKP)](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/crypto/zero-knowledge-proof-zkp-explained)
            technology and how it works.**


            ## Use Cases for Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) in Blockchain


            Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are transforming how blockchain technology
            manages privacy and data integrity. Here''s how they''re being applied
            across various crypto projects and blockchain-based applications:


            1. **Financial Privacy:** ZKPs enable transactions where the validity
            of a transaction is confirmed without revealing any information about
            the transaction itself. This is crucial in cryptocurrencies like Zcash,
            where users can choose to hide transaction details such as the sender,
            recipient, and amount transferred while still maintaining a secure and
            verified ledger.


            2. **Scalable Blockchain Solutions:** Projects like zkSync and StarkWare
            utilize ZKPs to increase [blockchain scalability](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/crypto/blockchain-layer-1-vs-layer-2-scaling-solutions-explained).
            They use a technique called zk-Rollups, where transaction data is processed
            off-chain, and only the validity proofs are submitted to the blockchain.
            This drastically reduces the data load on the main chain, enabling faster
            and cheaper transactions.


            3. **Secure Voting Systems:** ZKPs can be used to ensure the integrity
            and anonymity of votes in electronic voting systems. They allow voters
            to prove their vote was counted without revealing who they voted for,
            providing privacy and transparency in the voting process.


            4. **Authentication Without Passwords:** In systems that require authentication,
            ZKPs can verify the identity of a user without the need to transmit a
            password or any other sensitive information. This method prevents attackers
            from intercepting passwords during transmission, enhancing the security
            of online platforms.


            5. **Supply Chain Traceability:** ZKPs can help verify the authenticity
            of products in a supply chain without revealing underlying trade secrets
            or confidential business information. For instance, a company could prove
            that its products meet certain environmental standards without disclosing
            its suppliers or detailed manufacturing processes.


            6. **Confidential Smart Contracts:** Platforms like [Aleph Zero](https://www.kucoin.com/price/AZERO)
            and [Mina Protocol](https://www.kucoin.com/price/MINA) are exploring the
            use of ZKPs to execute smart contracts that keep certain inputs and outputs
            private. This is particularly valuable in business contexts where contract
            details are sensitive and should not be publicly disclosed on the blockchain.



            ## Top Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) Projects of 2024


            CoinGecko has listed 40 ZK crypto projects with a combined market cap

            (PoE), designed to maintain network security and decentralization while
            being less vulnerable to the complexities and potential attacks associated
            with the earlier Proof of Donation (PoD) system. Recent advancements include
            the integration of Hermez into Polygon’s ecosystem, reflecting a strategic
            move towards enhancing Ethereum’s scalability using zero-knowledge technology.


            Key features of Polygon Hermez include substantial reductions in transaction
            costs—over 90% compared to Ethereum’s [mainnet](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/glossary/mainnet)—and
            significant throughput improvements, supporting the network''s scalability.
            However, challenges such as the complexity of ZK proofs and the need for
            specialized knowledge to implement and optimize these technologies could
            pose barriers to adoption. Looking forward, Polygon Hermez is set to continue
            evolving, focusing on enhancing its technology to better serve a growing

            ### Mina Protocol (MINA)


            ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Mgi2FQJoUFwuclcw-mnzyuYN0hpcCBa4YyBu4B3qlzF2VQsNzGzXZ55ZseD4LCg_XgPG1uUjzkMB4QyF9f1jazmnUChcUV-mb5fMLSiw15JSVDnnS76t1VFB-pKzVXVxuUYtezqeyYTk_GJGSfdkxlg)


            Mina Protocol (MINA) stands out as a blockchain that focuses on true decentralization
            by maintaining a consistent, minimal blockchain size of only 22KB. This
            is achieved using Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of
            Knowledge (zk-SNARKs). This technique enables Mina to compress entire
            blockchain states into small snapshots, allowing any user to quickly verify
            the network''s state without needing to download a large blockchain history.
            This approach not only ensures greater accessibility but also reduces
            reliance on powerful intermediaries, thus preserving the decentralized
            nature of the blockchain.


            Mina''s mission is to streamline blockchain participation by making it
            as lightweight as possible, ensuring that anyone can verify the network
            right from their devices. This is achieved through its unique zk-SNARK
            technology, which updates with each new block, continuously compressing
            the blockchain''s history into a small proof. Mina also employs the Ouroboros
            Samisika [proof-of-stake](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos)
            [consensus mechanism](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/glossary/consensus-mechanism),
            which is less resource-intensive than traditional [proof-of-work](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/glossary/proof-of-work-pow)
            systems. Recent updates within the Mina ecosystem include advancements
            in [node](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/glossary/node) performance and
            the introduction of zkApps, which allow for [off-chain](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/glossary/off-chain)
            computation and enhanced privacy for [smart contracts](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/glossary/smart-contract).
            However, the innovative approach of using zk-SNARKs for all state transitions
            can introduce complexities in maintaining and developing on such a unique

            This technology allows dYdX to execute and verify trades on its decentralized
            platform without revealing any sensitive data about the transactions themselves.
            Using zk-STARKs is particularly advantageous because it offers high scalability
            and security without needing a trusted setup, which is required by another
            common type of ZKP known as zk-SNARKs.


            Recent developments in dYdX have seen the launch of version 4.0 (v4.0)
            of their platform, which includes the dYdX Chain—an open-source blockchain
            utilizing the [Cosmos](https://www.kucoin.com/price/ATOM) SDK for scalability
            and the CometBFT consensus protocol for security. This upgrade introduces
            features such as reduce-only orders and subaccount withdrawal gating to
            enhance trading [risk management](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/trading/mastering-risk-management-in-crypto-trading)
            and governance capabilities. However, the platform''s cutting-edge approach
            and reliance on complex technologies could pose challenges for less tech-savvy
            users. Additionally, while dYdX provides powerful tools for traders, the

            ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/_S9G2f49EaoRWqvIb3k4Sse47CLQBVSA5L_MA5UVhqnuNI9HXX1IfK1BwTg5-DM0G4C3LoExQSBUep0oxOjQfNVPXHv-YXIUOWHOHZDElRnBv-tzvSJyZF3Uw8e2q6hi2oe95Rvi4pebJVLlnKURB4c)


            [Loopring](https://www.kucoin.com/price/LRC) (LRC) is an advanced blockchain
            protocol based on Ethereum, which leverages Zero-Knowledge Rollups (zkRollups)
            to enhance the scalability and efficiency of decentralized exchanges (DEXs)
            and payment platforms. At its core, Loopring allows for the aggregation
            of hundreds of transactions into a single one, significantly reducing
            the gas costs and processing times associated with Ethereum transactions.
            The Loopring protocol achieves this by handling transactions off-chain
            and then settling them on-chain using zkRollups, which provides proof
            that transactions were executed correctly without revealing the transaction
            data itself. This method ensures both speed and security, allowing Loopring
            to process over 2,000 transactions per second​.


            The Loopring protocol also introduces a unique component called "ring
            miners," who match, verify, and settle trading orders. Miners are compensated
            for their services with fees in LRC or a split of the trading margins,
            creating an incentive for efficient order processing. Loopring''s architecture
            supports both automated market maker ( [AMM](https://www.kucoin.com/blog/what-are-automated-market-makers))
            models and traditional order book exchanges, making it versatile for various
            [trading strategies](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/trading). Despite its
            advantages, such as lower transaction costs and higher throughput, Loopring''s
            reliance on more complex technologies like zkRollups could pose a barrier
            to widespread adoption due to the technical knowledge required to implement
            and interact with such systems. Nonetheless, Loopring remains a significant
            player in the effort to scale Ethereum''s capabilities without compromising
            security.

            [Zcash](https://www.kucoin.com/price/ZEC) (ZEC) is a cryptocurrency focused
            on enhancing privacy for its users, leveraging advanced cryptographic
            techniques known as zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive
            Arguments of Knowledge) to enable secure, private transactions. Unlike
            traditional cryptocurrencies that offer pseudonymity, Zcash provides the
            option of "shielded" transactions, which keep the sender, receiver, and
            transaction amount private. Launched in 2016 as a fork of [Bitcoin](https://www.kucoin.com/price/BTC),
            Zcash aims to combine the financial privacy that cash transactions offer
            with the global digital utility of cryptocurrency​.


            Zcash has undergone significant developments since its inception, including
            multiple network upgrades such as Sprout, Overwinter, Sapling, and, more
            recently, Heartwood and Canopy. These updates have continuously improved
            transaction efficiency and privacy capabilities and introduced features
            like Shielded Coinbase and FlyClient support, enhancing the usability
            of Zcash for both everyday transactions and enterprise applications. The
            introduction of "Halo" in 2019 marked a significant technological advancement
            by removing the need for a trusted setup to generate zero-knowledge proofs,
            thereby increasing the security and scalability of the network. Despite
            its strong privacy features, Zcash faces challenges such as regulatory

            ### Worldcoin (WLD)


            ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/SCmyQsXOcb7UBznBiSo_sKsfmqkfMy2db-xvwTMRtdgBI9SSN6vwm4TDKThvqQ5LutRJPpFeULqa3V3wAbEe8znh5dvF2d-YDGzM2T5BN3cDYk8cFcEktrg3jNZ1YbsRN0BBRmkazG2jVwMGjKKdQUg)


            [Worldcoin](https://www.kucoin.com/price/WLD) (WLD) is a cryptocurrency
            project that combines digital identity verification with blockchain technology
            to provide a unique solution to global economic inclusion. The project,
            co-founded by Sam Altman, utilizes a device called an "Orb" to scan individuals''
            irises to create a secure, blockchain-based digital identity known as
            World ID. This identity is used to issue Worldcoin tokens (WLD) to individuals,
            promoting a decentralized and inclusive global economy.


            Worldcoin utilizes zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to enhance privacy andsecurity
            within its World ID system. Worldcoin employs ZKPs to confirm a user''s
            unique identity and humanity without disclosing any personal information.
            This allows for privacy-preserving interactions within the digital economy.
            Specifically, Worldcoin integrates a protocol called Semaphore, which
            uses ZKPs to enable users to prove membership in a group without revealing
            their identity. This is crucial for activities like voting or endorsements
            within the Worldcoin ecosystem, where privacy and anonymity are paramount.
            Implementing ZKPs ensures that activities carried out with a World ID
            cannot be linked to a person’s biometrics or other identity markers, safeguarding
            user privacy across different applications​.


            The project, however, has faced scrutiny and controversy, particularly
            regarding privacy and data security. The collection of biometric data
            through iris scanning has raised concerns about how this data is managed
            and protected. Additionally, the centralization of control over the project''s
            smart contracts has been viewed as contradictory to its decentralized
            ethos. Regulatory challenges also loom as different countries examine
            the legality and security of such biometric data collection. Despite these
            challenges, Worldcoin continues to expand to foster a more accessible
            and equitable digital economy. The initiative''s future success will depend
            significantly on its ability to address these privacy concerns and navigate
            regulatory environments effectively.

            ### Marlin (POND)


            ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ILpSD600xjehdORcEhh-0ps0ZWTU8AWjdB0XCv4p21lbmhc8FO9VWjyKqt6Dqm73RaUudxVhjeK2nKqUXIzGW9HnEQxubBu0GrdDsU4BXx4vNt-SFc1sZNwGLFTO3L9_G2xEkVXdm65dIbTKCB3KFuE)


            [Marlin](https://www.kucoin.com/price/POND) (POND) is a decentralized
            protocol designed to optimize the execution of complex algorithms and
            computations off-chain while maintaining the integrity and security typical
            of [on-chain](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/glossary/on-chain) processes.
            The core of Marlin''s architecture involves the use of coprocessors across
            a distributed network of nodes that enable high-speed data processing
            with access to both blockchain history and Web 2.0 APIs. This setup allows
            for the offloading of intensive computational tasks from the blockchain,
            reducing costs and speeding up execution time. The verification of these
            off-chain computations is ensured by combining Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)
            and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), which provide compact, secure
            verifications of computational correctness that can be easily validated
            on-chain​.


            Marlin has been developed to support a variety of programming environments
            and can execute programs written in languages like Solidity, C++, Rust,
            and Go. This flexibility is complemented by its scalable architecture,
            which includes different types of nodes, such as gateway, execution, and
            monitoring nodes, each serving a unique function within the network. Gateway
            nodes act as load balancers, execution nodes handle the actual computations,
            and monitoring nodes ensure the network''s reliability and performance.
            The Marlin ecosystem is powered by the POND token, which is used to provide
            security guarantees for the network. Nodes are required to stake POND
            tokens to participate, and they risk these stakes if they fail to adhere
            to the network''s operational standards. This staking mechanism incentivizes
            proper behavior and adherence to protocol rules.

            technologies. This protocol is geared to achieve high transaction throughputs
            with low fees and is built on a peer-reviewed system, ensuring robust,
            decentralized operation even amidst malicious activities. Aleph Zero''s
            consensus mechanism allows it to maintain efficient communication between
            nodes, which supports its claim of being both fast and secure​.


            A significant feature of Aleph Zero is its focus on privacy and security
            for enterprise applications through its multichain privacy layer, Liminal.
            Liminal employs zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and secure multi-party computation
            (sMPC), enhancing privacy across blockchain networks that link to Aleph
            Zero. This makes it highly adaptable for businesses requiring confidential
            transactions while leveraging public blockchain security. The platform
            also supports private smart contracts, which are advantageous for enterprises
            that need to perform secure and private transactions and computations.

            ## Challenges and Risks of Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Technology


            While Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) offer substantial benefits in privacy
            and scalability for blockchain applications, they also come with specific
            challenges and risks:


            1. **Complexity of Implementation:** Implementing ZKP requires a deep
            understanding of advanced cryptographic principles. This complexity can
            be a barrier for developers, potentially leading to errors and vulnerabilities
            in the design and implementation of ZKP systems. Developers must be well-versed
            in the underlying cryptography to ensure the integrity and security of
            the systems.


            2. **Computational Intensity:** The generation of ZKPs can be computationally
            intensive, especially for more complex proofs. This might result in higher
            costs and slower processing times compared to non-ZKP transactions, which
            could limit the practical usability of ZKPs in high-volume scenarios.


            3. **Initial Setup Vulnerability:** Certain ZKP schemes, like zk-SNARKs,
            require a "trusted setup" phase. If this setup phase is compromised, for
            example, if the generated parameters are not destroyed, it could lead
            to significant security vulnerabilities, including the creation of counterfeit
            proofs.


            4. **Scalability Concerns:** Although ZKPs can significantly reduce the
            data load on a blockchain, the scalability of ZKP implementations themselves
            can sometimes be a challenge. The technology to efficiently handle large
            volumes of transactions without compromising on speed is still under development.


            5. **Integration Complexity:** Integrating ZKP into existing systems poses
            significant challenges. It requires changes to the network protocols and
            possibly extensive updates to existing blockchain infrastructures, which
            can be a lengthy and complex process.


            6. **Legal and Regulatory Uncertainty:** The ability of ZKPs to anonymize
            transaction data could also raise regulatory issues, particularly in jurisdictions
            with strict financial transparency laws. Projects using ZKPs must navigate
            these regulations carefully to avoid legal challenges.



            Despite these challenges, the ongoing advancements in ZKP technology and
            increasing familiarity among developers are gradually reducing these risks,

            expected to enhance blockchain privacy and scalability. The focus will
            likely be on developing more user-friendly ZKP systems that could support
            widespread adoption across various industries. Innovations such as zk-STARKs
            and zk-SNARKs are anticipated to drive significant improvements in transaction
            speeds and scalability without compromising security or privacy.


            One of the most exciting prospects is the development of [cross-chain](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/glossary/cross-chain)
            privacy layers, which will allow secure and private transactions across
            different blockchain networks, thereby broadening the scope of blockchain
            applications and services​. These advancements could radically transform
            how sensitive data is handled across networks, making ZKPs integral to

            \ a more efficient\nproof construction method compared to state-of-the-art\
            \ ZKPs at that time. Next, we present the de-\nVirgo protocol, which builds\
            \ upon Libra’s design and further optimizes proof generation by lever-\n\
            aging the power of parallelization.\nThe third protocol, Orion, takes\
            \ a different approach, resulting in significant improvements in proof\n\
            generation speed. We detail the innovative design and methodology of Orion,\
            \ highlighting its\nunique features and performance gains.\nFinally, we\
            \ introduce the Pianist protocol, which employs parallel computation strategies\
            \ to achieve\nremarkable improvements in proof generation speed and is\
            \ compatible with existing popular pro-\ntocol Plonk. Pianist builds upon\
            \ the foundation established by Plonk, while incorporating novel\ntechniques\
            \ to enhance performance.\nThe dissertation includes a comprehensive comparative\
            \ analysis of the four proposed protocols,\nevaluating their scalability,\
            \ security, and practicality. In conclusion, our research contributes\
            \ to\nthe field of cryptography by providing a series of innovative ZKP\
            \ protocols that significantly en-\nhance proof generation speed, paving\
            \ the way for more widespread adoption of privacy-preserving\ntechnologies.\n\

            The rapid advancement of technology has led to a growing need for secure\
            \ and efficient crypto-\ngraphic protocols, particularly in the realm\
            \ of privacy-preserving computation. Zero-knowledge\nproofs (ZKPs) have\
            \ emerged as a powerful cryptographic primitive, enabling one party to\
            \ prove\nthe validity of a statement without revealing any additional\
            \ information about the underlying data.\nHowever, a major challenge in\
            \ the practical deployment of ZKPs is the efficiency of proof gen-\neration,\
            \ as it has a direct impact on the overall performance and scalability\
            \ of privacy-preserving\napplications.\nThis thesis focuses on the development\
            \ and optimization of novel techniques to significantly\nimprove the proof\
            \ generation speed of zero-knowledge proofs. We propose a series of innovative\n\
            protocols, divided into two parts: the first part, consisting of Libra\
            \ and Orion, aims to achieve opti-\nmal prover complexity, while the second\
            \ part, comprising deVirgo and Pianist, focuses on enabling\ndistributed\
            \ provers. These protocols leverage cutting-edge cryptographic techniques,\
            \ advanced opti-\nmizations, and novel constructions to enhance the performance\
            \ and scalability of ZKPs in real-world\napplications.\nIn the first part\
            \ of this thesis, we introduce Libra, a protocol that addresses the existing\
            \ limi-\ntations of proof generation speed by employing an optimal GKR\
            \ protocol and introducing several\noptimizations. We then present Orion,\
            \ which provides an optimal polynomial commitment, offer-\ning substantial\
            \ performance improvements over previous protocols and combined with Libra,\
            \ we\ncan achieve optimal prover complexity.\nIn the second part, we describe\
            \ deVirgo, a protocol that builds upon the advancements made\nby Libra\
            \ and Orion, and focuses on enabling distributed provers. deVirgo further\
            \ improves proof\ngeneration speed by incorporating a novel recursive\
            \ composition technique. Lastly, we introduce\nPianist, a groundbreaking\
            \ protocol that leverages parallelization techniques to facilitate distributed\n\
            provers, setting a new benchmark in the field of zero-knowledge proofs.\n\
            Throughout this thesis, we provide rigorous security analysis and comprehensive\
            \ performance\nevaluations for each proposed protocol, demonstrating their\
            \ practicality and effectiveness in various\nprivacy-preserving applications.\
            \ By significantly improving the proof generation speed of zero-\nknowledge\
            \ proofs and enabling distributed provers, our work not only advances\
            \ the state-of-the-\nart in cryptographic research but also paves the\
            \ way for more widespread adoption of privacy-\n\n1.1. ACHIEVING OPTIMAL\
            \ PROVER TIME2\npreserving technologies across diverse domains.\n1.1 Achieving\
            \ Optimal Prover time\nPrevious protocols require a prover running quasi-linear\
            \ time in the statement size, and each state-\nment needs a separate trusted\
            \ setup. They are both time-consuming. The first part of this thesis\n\
            focuses on the development and optimization of Libra\\[XZZPS19a\\] and\
            \ Orion\\[XZS22\\], two innova-\ntive zero-knowledge proof systems that\
            \ aim to achieve optimal prover complexity. These protocols\nbuild upon\
            \ cutting-edge cryptographic techniques and advanced optimizations to\
            \ improve the effi-\nciency of proof generation in various privacy-preserving\
            \ applications. We also developed libraries\nof these protocols and released\
            \ codes online \\[Libb; Vira; Virb\\] for developers.\n1.1.1 Libra\nLibra\
            \ is built upon a new linear-time algorithm for the prover of the interactive\
            \ proof protocol by\nGoldwasser, Kalai, and Rothblum\\[GKR15\\], also\
            \ known as the GKR protocol. Additionally, Libra\nemploys an efficient\
            \ approach to convert the GKR protocol into a zero-knowledge proof using\
            \ small\nmasking polynomials. Notably, Libra features a one-time trusted\
            \ setup that depends only on the size\nof the input to the circuit and\
            \ not on the circuit logic.\nNot only does Libra boast excellent asymptotic\
            \ performance, but it is also highly efficient in\npractice. For instance,\
            \ our implementation demonstrates that it takes only200seconds to generate\
            \ a\nproof for constructing a SHA2-based Merkle tree root on256leaves,\
            \ outperforming all existing zero-\nknowledge proof systems. Both the\
            \ proof size and verification time of Libra are highly competitive,\n\
            making it a significant advancement in the field of zero-knowledge proofs.\n\
            1.1.2 Orion\nIn this subsection, we introduce Orion, a groundbreaking\
            \ zero-knowledge argument system that\nachievesO(N)prover time of field\
            \ operations and hash functions, andO(log\n2\nN)proof size. Orion\nstands\
            \ out for its concretely efficient performance, addressing the high overhead\
            \ on proof generation\ntime that has limited the efficiency and scalability\
            \ of existing schemes with succinct proof size.\nOur implementation of\
            \ Orion demonstrates remarkable performance, with a prover time of 3.09\n\
            seconds and a proof size of 1.5MB for a circuit with2\n20\nmultiplication\
            \ gates. Notably, the prover\ntime is the fastest among all existing succinct\
            \ proof systems, and the proof size is an order of\nmagnitude smaller\
            \ than a recent scheme proposed by Golovnev et al. in 2021 \\[GLSTW\\\
            ].\nOrion’s efficiency improvements can be attributed to two novel techniques.\
            \ Firstly, we propose a\nnew algorithm for testing whether a random bipartite\
            \ graph is a lossless expander graph based on the\ndensest subgraph algorithm.\
            \ This approach allows us to sample lossless expander with overwhelm-\n\
            ing probability, improving the efficiency and/or security of all existing\
            \ zero-knowledge argument\nschemes with linear prover time. The testing\
            \ algorithm based on the densest subgraph may also be\nof independent\
            \ interest for other applications of expander graphs.\n\n1.2. DISTRIBUTED\
            \ PROVING3\nSecondly, we develop an efficient proof composition scheme\
            \ called code switching, which re-\nduces the proof size from square root\
            \ to polylogarithmic in the size of the computation. This scheme\nis built\
            \ on the encoding circuit of a linear code and demonstrates that the witness\
            \ of a second\nzero-knowledge argument is the same as the message in the\
            \ linear code. The proof composition\nintroduces only a small overhead\
            \ on the prover time, further enhancing the performance of Orion.\nBy\
            \ combining Orion with Libra, a fully optimal prover in terms of complexity\
            \ can be achieved,\nsignificantly advancing the field of zero-knowledge\
            \ proofs.\n1.2 Distributed Proving\nThe second part of this thesis presents\
            \ another line of work focused on parallelizing and distributing\nzero-knowledge\
            \ proof systems. In this direction, we introduce deVirgo\\[Xie+22\\],\
            \ a novel protocol\nthat builds upon the Libra and Virgo protocols to\
            \ achieve parallel and distributed proof generation.\nThis approach improves\
            \ the scalability and efficiency of zero-knowledge proofs, expanding their\n\
            applicability in various privacy-preserving applications.\ndeVirgo takes\
            \ advantage of the strengths of both Libra and Virgo. By parallelizing\
            \ the prover\nand enabling distributed proof generation, deVirgo tackles\
            \ the challenges posed by large-scale\ncomputations and high prover complexity,\
            \ which have traditionally limited the practicality of zero-\nknowledge\
            \ proof systems.\nThe development of deVirgo represents a significant\
            \ advancement in the field of zero-knowledge\nproofs, enhancing their\
            \ performance and scalability.\nAnother significant protocol is Pianist,\
            \ a significant protocol built on the Plonk proof system,\nleverages key\
            \ features and optimizations such as bi-variate KZG\\[KZG\\] commitments\
            \ and Lagrange-\nbased techniques. These innovations make the distributed\
            \ proving system more scalable and effi-\ncient.\nThe bi-variate KZG commitments\
            \ with Lagrange-based techniques aim at reducing the size of\ncommunication\
            \ between machines. As a result, Pianist achieves a significantly reduced\
            \ communi-\ncation overhead of just several kilobytes.\n1.2.1 deVirgo\n\
            In this subsection, we delve into the details of deVirgo, a distributed\
            \ SNARK protocol designed\nfor data-parallel circuits. Data-parallel circuits,\
            \ as mentioned earlier, consist of multiple identical\nsub-circuits with\
            \ no connections between them. This characteristic allows each sub-circuit\
            \ to be\nprocessed independently, providing an opportunity to accelerate\
            \ proof generation by handling them\nin parallel.\ndeVirgo is built upon\
            \ the Virgo protocol for two main reasons: firstly, Virgo does not require\
            \ a\ntrusted setup and is plausibly post-quantum secure; secondly, Virgo\
            \ is among the fastest protocols\nwith succinct verification time and\
            \ proof size for large-scale problems. deVirgo extends Virgo to\nhandle\
            \ data-parallel arithmetic circuits, achieving optimal scalability without\
            \ any overhead on proof\nsize. The protocol is specifically designed to\
            \ process data-parallel circuits with N copies using N\n\n1.2. DISTRIBUTED\
            \ PROVING4\nparallel machines, resulting in N times faster performance\
            \ than the original Virgo while maintaining\nthe same proof size.\nThe\
            \ deVirgo protocol operates with a master node and several ordinary nodes,\
            \ with the master\nnode responsible for aggregating messages and proofs\
            \ from distributed machines. This setup elim-\ninates the need for a linear\
            \ increase in proof size, which would occur if each sub-circuit generated\n\
            its proof separately. The protocol is composed of two primary building\
            \ blocks: the GKR protocol\nand the polynomial commitment (PC) scheme.\n\
            The GKR protocol consists of d sumcheck protocols for a circuit of depth\
            \ d, and in the dis-\ntributed sumcheck protocol of deVirgo, the master\
            \ node aggregates messages from all machines\nin every round. This approach\
            \ maintains the same proof size as the original sumcheck protocol,\nsaving\
            \ a factor N over the naive distributed protocol.\nIn the distributed\
            \ PC protocol, the commitment phase is optimized, allowing the master\
            \ node to\naggregate N commitments into one, rather than sending N commitments\
            \ directly to the verifier. Dur-\ning the opening phase, the proof can\
            \ also be aggregated, improving the proof size by a logarithmic\nfactor\
            \ in the size of the polynomial.\nBy combining these techniques, deVirgo\
            \ offers a powerful and efficient solution for processing\ndata-parallel\
            \ circuits, paving the way for more scalable and practical zero-knowledge\
            \ proof systems.\n1.2.2 Pianist\nIn this subsection, we introduce Pianist,\
            \ a fully distributed zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) system de-\nsigned to\
            \ enhance the scalability of blockchain technologies such as zkRollups\
            \ and zkEVM. One of\nthe primary challenges in deploying blockchains is\
            \ the limited throughput of transactions. Pianist\naddresses this issue\
            \ by distributing the ZKP generation process across multiple machines,\
            \ signifi-\ncantly reducing the burden on individual machines and improving\
            \ overall efficiency.\nPianist is built upon Plonk, a highly efficient\
            \ ZKP system with a universal trusted setup. The\nproposed distributed\
            \ ZKP scheme enables proof generation to be distributed across multiple\
            \ par-\nticipants in a mining pool-like model. Pianist’s first protocol\
            \ is tailored for data-parallel circuits,\noffering a prover time complexity\
            \ ofO(TlogT+MlogM)per machine when using M machines\nto process M sub-circuits\
            \ of size T each. This is in contrast to theO(M TlogM T)prover time\n\
            complexity of the original Plonk on a single machine.\nThe protocol ensures\
            \ minimal communication among machines, withO(1)communication per\nmachine.\
            \ The proof size and verifier time complexity are alsoO(1), which is the\
            \ same as the orig-\ninal Plonk. Furthermore, Pianist’s second protocol,\
            \ with minor modifications, can support general\ncircuits with arbitrary\
            \ connections while maintaining the same proving, verifying, and communica-\n\
            tion complexities.\nThe Pianist system, when implemented, can generate\
            \ a proof for 8,192 transactions in just 313\nseconds using 64 machines.\
            \ This represents a 64x improvement in scalability compared to the\noriginal\
            \ Plonk scheme. The communication per machine is a mere 2.1 KB, independent\
            \ of the\nnumber of machines and circuit size. The proof size is 2.2 KB,\
            \ and the verifier time is 3.5 ms.\nPianist also shows similar improvements\
            \ for general circuits; for example, it takes only 5 seconds to\n\n1.2.\
            \ DISTRIBUTED PROVING5\ngenerate a proof for a randomly generated circuit\
            \ with2\n2\n5gates using 32 machines, which is 24.2\ntimes faster than\
            \ Plonk on a single machine.\nBy leveraging Pianist’s distributed ZKP\
            \ schemes, blockchain technologies can achieve higher\nscalability and\
            \ efficiency, enabling broader adoption in various applications.\n1.2.3\
            \ Cross-chain bridges for blockchains\nIn this subsection, we introduce\
            \ zkBridge, a highly efficient and secure cross-chain bridge designed\n\
            for the increasingly diverse blockchain ecosystem. As various blockchains\
            \ coexist, cross-chain\ncommunication becomes a crucial building block,\
            \ and zkBridge aims to address this need.\nExisting cross-chain bridge\
            \ solutions often face performance issues or rely on trust assumptions,\n\
            which can result in compromised security. With over 1.5 billion USD lost\
            \ in attacks against bridges,\nthere is a pressing need for a more secure\
            \ solution. zkBridge addresses this issue by providing strong\nsecurity\
            \ without external trust assumptions and using succinct proofs to guarantee\
            \ correctness while\nreducing on-chain verification costs.\nzkBridge takes\
            \ advantage of the distributed proof systems deVirgo (or use the alternative\
            \ Pi-\nanist), which offer significant performance improvements over existing\
            \ solutions. By utilizing these\nproof systems, zkBridge can achieve dramatically\
            \ faster proof generation speed, enabling secure and\nefficient cross-chain\
            \ communication.\nMoreover, the modular design of zkBridge allows it to\
            \ support a wide range of use cases and\ncapabilities, such as message\
            \ passing, token transferring, and computational logic operating on\n\
            state changes across different chains. To demonstrate the practicality\
            \ of zkBridge, a prototype\nbridge from Cosmos to Ethereum was implemented,\
            \ showcasing its ability to handle large proof\ncircuits that other systems\
            \ cannot efficiently manage. The evaluation of this prototype revealed\
            \ that\nzkBridge achieves practical performance, with proof generation\
            \ taking less than 20 seconds and on-\nchain verification costing less\
            \ than 230K gas. Additionally, the implementation and evaluation of\n\
            the direction from Ethereum to other EVM-compatible chains, like BSC,\
            \ further proved zkBridge’s\nversatility and efficiency.\nOverall, zkBridge\
            \ serves as an innovative and highly effective solution for cross-chain\
            \ com-\nmunication in the multi-chain ecosystem, leveraging the power\
            \ of distributed proof systems like\ndeVirgo to ensure secure, scalable,\
            \ and efficient performance.\n\n6\nChapter 2\nLibra: Succinct Zero-Knowledge\
            \ Proofs\nwith Optimal Prover Computation\nWe presentLibra, the first\
            \ zero-knowledge proof system that has both optimal prover time and\n\
            succinct proof size/verification time. In particular, ifCis the size of\
            \ the circuit being proved (i)\nthe prover time isO(C)irrespective of\
            \ the circuit type; (ii) the proof size and verification time are\nbothO(dlogC)ford-depth\
            \ log-space uniform circuits (such as RAM programs). In additionLibra\n\
            features an one-time trusted setup that depends only on the size of the\
            \ input to the circuit and not\non the circuit logic. UnderlyingLibrais\
            \ a new linear-time algorithm for the prover of the interactive\nproof\
            \ protocol by Goldwasser, Kalai and Rothblum (also known as GKR protocol),\
            \ as well as an\nefficient approach to turn the GKR protocol to zero-knowledge\
            \ using small masking polynomials.\nNot only doesLibrahave excellent asymptotics,\
            \ but it is also efficient in practice. For example, our\nimplementation\
            \ shows that it takes 200 seconds to generate a proof for constructing\
            \ a SHA2-based\nMerkle tree root on 256 leaves, outperforming all existing\
            \ zero-knowledge proof systems. Proof\nsize and verification time ofLibraare\
            \ also competitive.\nThis work was previously published in \\[XZZPS19b\\\
            ].\n\n2.1. INTRODUCTION7\n2.1 Introduction\nZero-knowledge proofs (ZKP)\
            \ are cryptographic protocols between two parties, aproverand aver-\n\
            ifier, in which the prover can convince the verifier about the validity\
            \ of a statement without leaking\nany extra information beyond the fact\
            \ that the statement is true. Since they were first introduced\nby Goldwasser\
            \ et al. \\[GMR89\\], ZKP protocols have evolved from pure theoretical\
            \ constructs to\npractical implementations, achieving proof sizes of just\
            \ hundreds of bytes and verification times of\nseveral milliseconds, regardless\
            \ of the size of the statement being proved. Due to this successful\n\
            transition to practice, ZKP protocols have found numerous applications\
            \ not only in the traditional\ncomputation delegation setting but most\
            \ importantly in providing privacy of transactions in de-\nployed cryptocurrencies\
            \ (e.g., Zcash \\[Ben+14\\]) as well as in other blockchain research projects\n\
            (e.g., Hawk \\[KMSWP\\]).\nDespite such progress in practical implementations,\
            \ ZKP protocols are still notoriously hard to\nscale for large statements,\
            \ due to a particularly high overhead on generating the proof. For most\
            \ sys-\ntems, this is primarily because the prover has to perform a large\
            \ number of cryptographic operations,\nsuch as exponentiation in an elliptic\
            \ curve group. And to make things worse the asymptotic com-\nplexity of\
            \ computing the proof is typically more than linear, e.g.,O(ClogC)or evenO(Clog\n\
            2\nC),\nwhereCis the size of the statement.\nUnfortunately, as of today\
            \ we are yet to construct a ZKP system whose prover time isoptimal,\n\
            i.e., linear in the size of the statementC(this is irrespective of whether\
            \ the ZKP system has per-\nstatement trusted setup, one-time trusted setup\
            \ or no trusted setup at all). The only notable exception\nis the recent\
            \ work by Bünz et al. \\[BBBPWM18\\] that however suffers from linear\
            \ verification time—\nfor a detailed comparison see Table 2.1. Therefore\
            \ designing ZKP systems that enjoy linear prover\ntime as well as succinct¹\
            \ proof size and verification time is an open problem, whose resolution\
            \ can\nhave significant practical implications.\nOur contributions.In\
            \ this paper we proposeLibra, the first ZKP protocol withlinear prover\
            \ time\nandsuccinct proof size and verification timein the size of the\
            \ arithmetic circuit representing the\nstatementC, when the circuit islog-space\
            \ uniform.Librais based on the doubly efficient interactive\nproof protocol\
            \ proposed by Goldwasser et al. in \\[GKR15\\] (referred as GKR protocol\
            \ in this paper),\nand the verifiable polynomial delegation scheme proposed\
            \ by Zhang et al. in \\[ZGKPP17c\\]. As such\nit comes withone-time trustedsetup\
            \ (and not per-statement trusted setup) that depends only on the\nsize\
            \ of the input (witness) to the statement that is being proved. Not only\
            \ doesLibrahave excellent\nasymptotic performance but also its prover\
            \ outperforms in practice all other ZKP systems while ver-\nification\
            \ time and proof size are also very competitive—see Table 2.1. Our concrete\
            \ contributions\nare:\n•GKR with linear prover time.Librafeatures a new\
            \ linear-time algorithm to generate a GKR\nproof. Our new algorithm does\
            \ not require any pattern in the circuit and our result subsumes\nall\
            \ existing improvements on the GKR prover assuming special circuit structures,\
            \ such as regular\ncircuits in \\[Tha13a\\], data-parallel circuits in\

            ]. See related work for more details.\n¹In ZKP literature, “succinct”\
            \ is poly-logarithmic in the size of the statementC.\n\n2.1. INTRODUCTION8\n\
            •Adding zero-knowledge.We propose an approach to turnLibrainto zero-knowledge\
            \ efficiently.\nIn particular, we show a way to mask the responses of\
            \ our linear-time prover with small random\npolynomials such that the\
            \ zero-knowledge variant of the protocol introduces minimal overhead\n\
            on the verification time compared to the original (unmasked) construction.\n\
            •Implementation and evaluation.We implementLibra. Our implementation takes\
            \ an arithmetic\ncircuit with various types of gates (fan-in 2 and degree≤2,\
            \ such as+,−,×, AND, XOR, etc.)\nand compiles it into a ZKP protocol.\
            \ We conduct thorough comparisons to all existing ZKP\nsystems (see Section\
            \ 2.1.1). We plan to release our system as an open-source implementation.\n\
            2.1.1 Comparing to other ZKP Systems\nTable 2.1 shows a detailed comparison\
            \ betweenLibraand existing ZKP systems. First of all,Librais\nthe best\
            \ among all existing systems in terms of practical prover time. In terms\
            \ of asymptotics,Libra\nis the only system with linear prover time and\
            \ succinct verification and proof size for log-space uni-\nform circuits.\
            \ The only other system with linear prover time isBulletproofs\\[BBBPWM18\\\
            ] whose\nverification time is linear,even for log-space uniform circuits.\
            \ In the practical front,Bulletproofs\nprover time and verification time\
            \ are high, due to the large number of cryptographic operations\nrequired\
            \ for every gate of the circuit.\nThe proof and verification ofLibraare\
            \ also competitive to other systems. In asymptotic terms,\nour proof size\
            \ is only larger thanlibSNARK\\[BSCTV14c\\] andBulletproofs\\[BBBPWM18\\\
            ], and\nour verification is slower thanlibSNARK\\[BSCTV14c\\] andlibSTARK\\\
            [BSBHR19\\]. Compared to\nHyrax\\[WTSTW18\\], which is also based on similar\
            \ techniques with our work,Libraimproves the\nperformance in all aspects\
            \ (yetHyraxdoes not have any trusted setup). One can refer to Section\
            \ 2.5\nfor a detailed description of our experimental setting as well\
            \ as a more detailed comparison.\nFinally, among all systems,libSNARK\\\
            [BSCTV14c\\] requires a trusted setup for every statement,\nandLibrarequires\
            \ an one-time trusted setup that depends on the input size. See Section\
            \ 2.5.3 for a\ndiscussion on removing trusted setup inLibra.\nLog-space\

            \ contributions are a GKR protocol with linear prover time and an efficient\
            \ ap-\nproach to turn the GKR protocol into zero-knowledge. We summarize\
            \ the key ideas behind these\ntwo contributions. The detailed protocols\
            \ are presented in Section 2.3 and 2.4 respectively.\nGKR with linear\
            \ prover.Goldwasser et al. \\[GKR15\\] showed an approach to model the\
            \ evaluation\nof a layered circuit as a sequence of summations on polynomials\
            \ defined by values in consecutive\nlayers of the circuit. Using the famous\
            \ sumcheck protocol (see Section 2.2.3.1), they developed a\nprotocol\
            \ (the GKR protocol) allowing the verifier to validate the circuit evaluation\
            \ in logarithmic\ntime with a logarithmic size proof. However, the polynomials\
            \ in the protocol are multivariate with\n2svariables, whereSis the number\
            \ of gates in one layer of the circuit ands= logS. Naively\nrunning the\
            \ sumcheck protocol on these polynomials incursS\n2\nprover time, as there\
            \ are at least\n2\n2s\n=S\n2\nmonomials in a2s-variate polynomial. Later,\
            \ Cormode et al. \\[CMT12\\] observed that\nthese polynomials are sparse,\
            \ containing onlySnonzero monomials and improved the prover time\ntoSlogS.\n\
            In our new approach, we divide the protocol into two separate sumchecks.\
            \ In each sumcheck, the\npolynomial only containssvariables, and can be\
            \ expressed as the product of two multilinear poly-\nnomials. Utilizing\
            \ the sparsity of the circuit, we develop new algorithms to scan through\
            \ each gate\nof the circuit and compute the closed-form of all these multilinear\
            \ polynomials explicitly, which\ntakesO(S)time. With this new way of representation,\
            \ the prover can deploy a dynamic program-\n¹STARKis in the RAM model.\
            \ To compare the performance, we convert a circuit of sizeCto a RAM program\n\
            withT= Θ(C)steps.\n\n2.1. INTRODUCTION10\nming technique to generate the\
            \ proofs in each sumcheck inO(S)time, resulting in a total prover\ntime\
            \ ofO(S).\nEﬀicient zero-knowledge GKR.The original GKR protocol is not\
            \ zero-knowledge, since the mes-\nsages in the proof can be viewed as\
            \ weighed sums of the values in the circuit and leak information.\nIn\
            \ \\[ZGKPP17a; WTSTW18\\], the authors proposed to turn the GKR protocol\
            \ into zero-knowledge\nby hiding the messages in homomorphic commitments,\
            \ which incurs a big overhead in the verifi-\ncation time. In \\[CFS17\\\
            ], Chiesa et al. proposed an alternative approach by masking the protocol\n\
            with random polynomials. However, the masking polynomials are as big as\
            \ the original ones and\nthe prover time becomes exponential, making the\
            \ approach mainly of theoretical interest.\nIn our scheme, we first show\
            \ that in order to make the sumcheck protocol zero-knowledge, the\nprover\
            \ can mask it with a “small” polynomial. In particular, the masking polynomial\
            \ only contains\nlogarithmically many random coefficients. The intuition\
            \ is that though the original polynomial\nhasO(2\nℓ\n)or more terms (ℓis\
            \ the number of variables in the polynomial), the prover only sends\n\
            O(ℓ)messages in the sumcheck protocol. Therefore, it suffices to mask\
            \ the original polynomial\nwith a random one withO(ℓ)coefficients to achieve\
            \ zero-knowledge. In particular, we set the\nmasking polynomial as the\
            \ sum ofℓunivariate random polynomials with the same variable-degree.\n\
            In Section 2.4.1, we show that the entropy of this mask exactly counters\
            \ the leakage of the sumcheck,\nproving that it is sufficient and optimal.\n\
            Besides the sumcheck, the GKR protocol additionally leaks two evaluations\
            \ of the polynomial\ndefined by values in each layer of the circuit. To\
            \ make these evaluations zero-knowledge, we mask\nthe polynomial by a\
            \ special low-degree random polynomial. In particular, we show that after\
            \ the\nmask, the verifier in total learns 4 messages related to the evaluations\
            \ of the masking polynomial\nand we can prove zero-knowledge by making\
            \ these messages linearly independent. Therefore, the\nmasking polynomial\
            \ is of constant size: it consists of 2 variables with variable degree\
            \ 2.\n2.1.3 Related Work\nIn recent years there has been significant progress\
            \ in efficient ZKP protocols and systems. In this\nsection, we discuss\
            \ related work in this area, with the focus on those with sublinear proofs.\n\

            \ constant, and the\nverification time depends only on the input size.\
            \ Both these properties are particularly appealing and\nhave led to real-world\
            \ deployments, e.g., ZCash \\[Ben+14\\]. One of the main bottlenecks,\
            \ however,\nof QAP-based systems is the high overhead in the prover running\
            \ time and memory consumption,\nmaking it hard to scale to large statements.\

            \ extensions instead\nof low degree extensions. Several follow-up works\
            \ further reduce the prover time assuming special\nstructures of the circuit.\

            \ showed a protocol withO(ClogC\n′\n)prover time.\nIn \\[ZGKPP17c\\],\
            \ Zhang et al. extended the GKR protocol to an argument system using a\
            \ proto-\ncol for verifiable polynomial delegation. Zhang et al. \\[ZGKPP18\\\
            ] and Wahby et al. \\[WTSTW18\\]\nmake the argument system zero-knowledge\
            \ by putting all the messages in the proof into homo-\nmorphic commitments,\
            \ as proposed by Cramer and Damgard in \\[CD98\\]. This approach intro-\n\
            duces a high overhead on the verification time compared to the plain argument\
            \ system without\nzero-knowledge, as each addition becomes a multiplication\
            \ and each multiplication becomes an ex-\nponentiation in the homomorphic\
            \ commitments. The multiplicative overhead is around two orders\nof magnitude\
            \ in practice. Additionally, the scheme of \\[WTSTW18\\],Hyrax, removes\
            \ the trusted\nsetup of the argument system by introducing a new polynomial\
            \ delegation, increasing the proof\nsize and verification time toO(\n\
            √\nn)wherenis the input size of the circuit.\nLattice-based.Recently Baum\

            with sub-linear proof size. The proof size isO(\n√\nClog\n3\nC), and the\

            \ from two gates in the(i+ 1)-th layer; layer0is the output layer and\n\
            layerdis the input layer. The protocol proceeds layer by layer. Upon receiving\
            \ the claimed output\nfromP, in the first round,VandPrun the sumcheck\
            \ protocol to reduce the claim about the output\nto a claim about the\

            \ about\nlayeri−1to a claim about layerithrough the sumcheck protocol.\
            \ Finally, the protocol terminates\nwith a claim about the input layerd,\
            \ which can be checked directly byV, or is given as an oracle\naccess.\
            \ If the check passes,Vaccepts the claimed output.\nNotation.Before describing\

            the number of gates in thei-th layer asS\ni\nand lets\ni\n=⌈logS\ni\n\
            ⌉. (For simplicity, we assumeS\ni\nis\na power of 2, and we can pad the\
            \ layer with dummy gates otherwise.) We then define a function\nV\ni\n\
            :{0,1}\ns\ni\n→Fthat takes a binary stringb∈ {0,1}\ns\ni\nand returns\
            \ the output of gatebin layer\ni, wherebis called the gate label. With\
            \ this definition,V\n0\ncorresponds to the output of the circuit,\nandV\n\
            d\ncorresponds to the input layer. Finally, we define two additional functionsadd\n\

            \ the sumcheck polynomials in GKR given by Equations 2.2 and 2.3\nsatisfy\
            \ these properties.\nWe note here that applying Algorithm 1FunctionEvaluationsfor\
            \ this particular class of polynomials\nwould lead to quadratic prover\

            \ off\n1\n: the prover can store only theO(2\nℓ\n)non-zero\nvalues of\
            \ the bookkeeping tableA. This is exactly the approach used in many prior\
            \ work \\[CMT12; Wah+17;\\\nZGKPP18\\]. However, with this approach, the\
            \ number of nonzero values that must be considered in Step 2\nis always\

            \ to half (i.e., to2\nℓ−i\n) after every\nupdate in Step 6 of Algorithm\

            ℓ\n).\nIn this section we effectively reduce this bound toO(2\nℓ\n). Our\
            \ protocol divides the sumcheck into two\nphases: the firstℓrounds bounding\
            \ the variables ofxto a random pointu, and the lastℓrounds bounding\n\
            the variables ofyto a random pointv. The central idea lies in rewriting\

            \ (see \\[GKR15\\]), and our new algorithms also\nimprove the prover time\
            \ of this to linear.\n\n2.3. GKR PROTOCOL WITH LINEAR PROVER TIME27\n\
            2.3.4 Putting everything together\nThe sumcheck protocol in GKR given\
            \ by Equation 2.2 can be decomposed into several instances that have\n\
            the form of Equation 2.6 presented in the previous section. The term\n\
            ∑\nx,y∈{0,1}\ns\ni+1\n ̃\nmult\ni+1\n(g, x, y)(\n ̃\nV\ni+1\n(x)\n ̃\n\
            V\ni+1\n(y))\nis exactly the same as Equation 2.6. The term\n∑\nx,y∈{0,1}\n\
            s\ni+1\n ̃\nadd\ni+1\n(g, x, y)(\n ̃\nV\ni+1\n(x) +\n ̃\nV\ni+1\n(y))can\
            \ be\nviewed as:\n∑\nx,y∈{0,1}\ns\ni+1\n ̃\nadd\ni+1\n(g, x, y)\n ̃\n\
            V\ni+1\n(x) +\n∑\nx,y∈{0,1}\ns\ni+1\n ̃\nadd\ni+1\n(g, x, y)\n ̃\nV\n\
            i+1\n(y)\nThe first sum can be computed using the same protocol in Algorithm\
            \ 6 withoutf\n3\n(y), and the second sum can\nbe computed withoutf\n2\n\
            (x). The complexity for both cases remains linear. Due to linearity of\
            \ the sumcheck\nprotocol, the prover can execute these 3 instances simultaneously\
            \ in every round, and sum up the individual\nmessages and send them to\
            \ the veriifer.\nCombining two claims.After the sumcheck in the GKR protocol\
            \ is completed, as described in Section 2.2.3,\nthe prover and the verifier\
            \ need to combine the two claims about\n ̃\nV\ni+1\nreceived at the end\
            \ of the sumcheck\nprotocol to one to avoid the exponential blow-up. There\
            \ are two ways to combine the two claims and we\nshow how to do each of\
            \ them in linear time.\nThe second approach using random linear combinations\
            \ is rather straight forward. After the output\nlayers,PandVexecute sumcheck\
            \ protocol on Equation 2.3 instead of Equations 2.2, which still satisfies\
            \ the\nproperties of Equation 2.6. One could view it as 6 instances of\
            \ Equation 2.6 and the prover time is still linear.\nMoreover, there is\
            \ a better way to further improve the efficiency. Taking\n∑\nx,y∈{0,1}\n\

            ]for allb. The rest of the\nalgorithms remains the same. This only incurs\
            \ a small overhead in practice in our implementation, compared\nto the\
            \ original algorithm on Equation 2.6.\nThough with the approach above\
            \ we already have a linear prover GKR protocol, the technique to condense\n\
            two points to one proposed in the original GKR protocol \\[GKR15\\] may\
            \ still be interesting in some scenarios\n(e.g., in our implementation,\
            \ we use this approach in the last layer and only make one query to the\
            \ multi-linear\nextension of the input, which is more efficient practice).\
            \ We present an algorithm to reduce two claims about\n ̃\nV\ni+1\nto one\
            \ in linear time. Recall that as described in Section 2.2.3, in thei-th\
            \ layer, after the sumcheck, the\nverifier receives two claims\n ̃\nV(u),\n\
            \ ̃\nV(v). (Again we omit the superscript and subscript ofifor the ease\
            \ of\ninterpretation.) She then defines a lineγ(x) :F→F\ns\nsuch thatγ(0)\
            \ =u, γ(1) =vand the prover needs to\nprovide\n ̃\nV(γ(x)), a degreesunivariate\
            \ polynomial, toV. If the prover computes it naively, which was done\n\
            in all prior papers, it incursO(s2\ns\n)time, as it is equivalent to evaluating\n\

            \ ̃\nV(y), whereI(a, b)is an identity\npolynomialI(a, b) = 0iffa=b. This\
            \ holds by inspection of both sides on the Boolean hypercube. We\nthen\
            \ evaluate the right side in linear time with a binary tree structure.\
            \ The key observation is that the identity\npolynomial can be written\
            \ asI(a, b) =\n∏\ns\nj=1\n(a\nj\nb\nj\n\\+ (1−a\nj\n)(1−b\nj\n)), and\
            \ we can process one variable\n(a\nj\n, b\nj\n) at a time and multiply\
            \ them together to get the final result.\nWe construct a binary tree with2\n\
            s\nleaves and initialize each leafb∈ {0,1}\ns\nwith\n ̃\nV(b). Asγ(x)is\
            \ a\nlinear polynomial, we write it asγ(x) = \\[c\\\n1\\\n, . . . , c\\\
            \ns\\\n\\]\nT\nx+ \\[d\\\n1\\\n, . . . , d\\\ns\\\n\\]\nT\n. At the leaf\
            \ level, we only consider\nthe last variable ofI(γ(x), y). For each leafb∈\
            \ {0,1}\ns\n, we multiply the value withb\ns\n(c\ns\nx+d\ns\n) \\+ (1−\n\
            b\ns\n)(1−c\ns\nx−d\ns\n), the result of which is a linear polynomial.\
            \ For a nodeb∈{0,1}\nj\nin the intermediate level\nj, we add the polynomials\
            \ from its two children, and multiply it withb\nj\n(c\nj\nx+d\nj\n) \\\
            + (1−b\nj\n)(1−c\nj\nx−d\nj\n),\nthe part inIthat corresponds to thej-th\
            \ variable. In this way, each node in thej-th level stores a degreej\n\
            polynomial. Eventually, the root is the polynomial on the right side of\
            \ degrees, which equals to\n ̃\nV(γ(x)).\nThe algorithm is given in Algorithm\
            \ 7.\nTo see the complexity of Algorithm 7, both the storage and the polynomial\
            \ multiplication at leveljis\nO(s−j+ 1)in each node. So the total time\
            \ isO(\n∑\ns\nj=1\n2\nj\n(s−j+ 1)) =O(2\ns\n), which is linear to the\n\
            number of gates in the layer.\nAn alternative way to interpret this result\
            \ is to add an additional layer for each layer of the circuit in GKR\n\
            relaying the values. That is,\n ̃\nV\ni\n(g) =\n∑\nx∈{0,1}\ns\ni\nI(g,\
            \ x)\n ̃\nV\ni+1\n(x),\nwhere\n ̃\nV\ni\n=\n ̃\nV\ni+1\n. Then when using\
            \ the random linear combination approach, the sumcheck is executed on\n\
            α\n ̃\nV\ni\n(u) +β\n ̃\nV\ni\n(v) =\n∑\nx∈{0,1}\ns\ni\n(αI(u, x) +βI(v,\
            \ x))\n ̃\nV\ni+1\n(x).\n\n2.4. ZERO-KNOWLEDGE ARGUMENT PROTOCOLS29\n\
            At the end of the sumcheck, the verifier receives a single claim on\n\
            \ ̃\nV\ni+1\n=\n ̃\nV\ni\n. The sumcheck can obviously\nrun in linear\
            \ time, and the relay layers do not change the result of the circuit.\
            \ This approach is actually the\nsame as the condensing to one point in\
            \ linear time above conceptually.\n2.4 Zero-Knowledge Argument Protocols\n\
            In this section, we present the construction of our new zero-knowledge\
            \ argument system. In \\[ZGKPP17c\\],\nZhang et al. proposed to combine\
            \ the GKR protocol with a verifiable polynomial delegation protocol, re-\n\
            sulting in an argument system. Later, in \\[ZGKPP17a; WTSTW18\\], the\
            \ construction was extended to zero-\nknowledge, by sending all the messages\
            \ in the GKR protocol in homomorphic commitments and performing\nall the\
            \ checks by zero-knowledge equality and product testing. This incurs a\
            \ high overhead for the verifier\ncompared to the plain version without\
            \ zero-knowledge, as each multiplication becomes an exponentiation\nand\
            \ each equality check becomes aΣ-protocol, which is around100×slower in\
            \ practice.\nIn this paper, we follow the same blueprint of combining\
            \ GKR and VPD to obtain an argument system,\nbut instead show how to extend\
            \ it to be zero-knowledge efficiently. In particular, the prover masks\
            \ the GKR\nprotocol with special random polynomials so that the verifier\
            \ runs a “randomized” GKR that leaks no extra\ninformation and her overhead\
            \ is small. A similar approach was used by Chiesa et al. in \\[CFS17\\\
            ]. In the fol-\nlowing, we present the zero-knowledge version of each\
            \ building block, followed by the whole zero-knowledge\nargument.\n2.4.1\
            \ Zero Knowledge Sumcheck\nAs a core step of the GKR protocol,PandVexecute\
            \ a sumcheck protocol on Equation 2.2, during which\nPsendsVevaluations\
            \ of the polynomial at several random points chosen byV. These evaluations\
            \ leak\ninformation about the values in the circuit, as they can be viewed\
            \ as weighted sums of these values.\nTo make the sumcheck protocol zero-knowledge,\
            \ we take the approach proposed by Chiesa et al. in\n\\[CFS17\\], which\
            \ is masking the polynomial in the sumcheck protocol by a random polynomial.\
            \ In this ap-\nproach, to prove\nH=\n∑\nx\n1\n,x\n2\n,...,x\nℓ\n∈{0,1}\n\
            f(x\n1\n, x\n2\n, . . . , x\nℓ\n),\nthe prover generates a random polynomialgwith\
            \ the same variables and individual degrees off. She commits\nto the polynomialg,\
            \ and sends the verifier a claimG=\n∑\nx\n1\n,x\n2\n,...,x\nℓ\n∈{0,1}\n\
            g(x\n1\n, x\n2\n, . . . , x\nℓ\n). The verifier picks\na random numberρ,\

            \ won a random point.\nWe instantiate the oracle using the zkVPD protocol.\
            \ Formally, we present the construction in Construction 4,\nwhich combines\
            \ our zero knowledge GKR and zkVPD protocols. Similar to the protocols\
            \ in \\[ZGKPP17a;\\\nWTSTW18\\], Step 6 and 7 are to check thatPindeed\
            \ usesxas the input to the circuit.\nTheorem 2.4.4.For an input sizenand\
            \ a finite fieldF, Construction 4 is a zero knowledge argument for the\n\
            relation\nR={(C, x;w) :C∈C\nF\n∧\\|x\\|+\\|w\\|≤n∧C(x;w) = 1},\nas defined\

            |). In casedispolylog(\\|C\\|), the protocol is a\nsuccinct argument.\n\
            Proof Sketch.The correctness and the soundness follow from those of the\
            \ two building blocks, zero knowl-\nedge GKR and zkVPD, by Theorem 2.4.2\
            \ and 2.4.3.\nTo prove zero knowledge, consider a simulatorSthat calls\
            \ the simulatorS\nGKR\nof zero knowledge GKR\ngiven in Section 2.4.2 as\
            \ a subroutine, which simulates the partial view up to the input layer.\
            \ At the input layer,\nthe major challenge is thatScommitted to (a randomly\
            \ chosen)\n ̇\nV\n∗\nd\nat the beginning of the protocol, before\nknowing\
            \ the pointsu\n(d)\n, v\n(d)\nto evaluate on. IfSopens the commitment\
            \ honestly, with high probability the\nevaluations are not consistent\
            \ with the last message of the GKR (sumcheck in layerd−1) and a malicious\n\
            V\n∗\ncan distinguish the ideal world from the real world. In our proof,\
            \ we resolve this issue by using the\nsimulatorS\nV P D\nof our zkVPD\
            \ protocol. Given the trapdoortrapused inKeyGen,S\nV P D\nis able to open\
            \ the\ncommitment to any value in zero knowledge, and in particular it\
            \ opens to those messages that are consistent\nwith the GKR protocol in\
            \ our scheme, which completes the construction ofS.\nThe complexity of\
            \ our zero knowledge argument scheme follows from our new GKR protocol\
            \ with linear\nprover time, and the complexity of the zkVPD protocol for\
            \ the input layer analyzed in Section 2.4.3. The\nmasking polynomialsg\n\
            i\n, R\ni\nand their commitments and openings introduce no asymptotic\
            \ overhead and are\nefficient in practice.\nRemovinginteraction.Our construction\
            \ can be made non-interactive in the random oracle model using Fiat–\n\
            -Shamir heuristic \\[FS86\\]. Though GKR protocol is not constant round,\
            \ recent results \\[BSCS16; CCHLRR18\\]\nshow that applying Fiat-Shamir\
            \ only incurs a polynomial soundness loss in the number of rounds in GKR.\n\
            In our implementation, the GKR protocol is on a 254-bit prime field matching\

            \ our new zero knowledge proof system in C++. There are around 3000\n\
            lines of code for the zkGKR protocol, 1000 lines for the zkVPD protocol\
            \ and 700 lines for circuit generators.\nOur system provides an interface\
            \ to take a generic layered arithmetic circuit and turn it into a zero\
            \ knowledge\nproof. We implement a new class for large integers named\
            \ u512, and use it together with the GMP\\[Gnu\\]\nlibrary for large numbers\
            \ and field arithmetic. We use the ate-pairing\\[Ate\\] library on a 254-bit\
            \ elliptic curve\nfor the bilinear map used in zkVPD. We plan to open-source\
            \ our system.\nHardware.We run all of the experiments on Amazon EC2 c5.9xlarge\
            \ instances with 70GB of RAM and\nIntel Xeon platinum 8124m CPU with 3GHz\
            \ virtual core. Our current implementation is not parallelized\n\n2.5.\
            \ IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION40\nand we only use a single CPU core in\
            \ the experiments. We report the average running time of 10 executions.\n\
            More gate types with no overhead.We first present a concrete optimization\
            \ we developed during the\nimplementation to support various types of\
            \ gates with no extra overhead. In our protocol in Section 2.3\nand 2.4,\
            \ we only consider addition and multiplication gates, as they are enough\
            \ to represent all arithmetic\ncircuits. However, in practice, the size\
            \ of the circuit can be reduced significantly if we introduce other types\n\
            of gate. The GKR protocol still works with these new gates, but they incur\
            \ an overhead on the prover time\nfor a circuit of the same size. Therefore,\
            \ in prior work such as \\[WHGSW16; ZGKPP18\\], this is considered\nas\
            \ a trade-off.\nOur protocol supports any gate with fan-in≤2and degree≤2with\
            \ no overhead on the prover. Recall\nthat in the GKR protocol, the values\
            \ in layeriis represented as a sumcheck of values in layeri+ 1and the\n\
            wiring predicates, as shown in Equation 2.2. With a set of gate typesT,\
            \ we can write the polynomial in the\nsum as\n∑\nj∈T\n ̃\ngate\n(j)\n\
            i\n(g, x, y)G\n(j)\ni\n(\n ̃\nV\ni+1\n(x),\n ̃\nV\ni+1\n(x)),\nwhereG\n\
            (j)\ni\n()is the computation of gate typej(e.g., for addition gates,G\n\
            (j)\ni\n(\n ̃\nV\ni+1\n(x),\n ̃\nV\ni+1\n(x)) =\n ̃\nV\ni+1\n(x)+\n ̃\n\
            V\ni+1\n(x)). As the gates have fan-in≤2and degree≤2,G\n(j)\ni\nhas up\
            \ to 2 variables and total degree at most 2 for\nallj. Therefore, eachG\n\
            (j)\ni\ncan be expressed explicitly asa\n0\n+a\n1\n ̃\nV\ni+1\n(x)+a\n\
            2\n ̃\nV\ni+1\n(y)+a\n3\n ̃\nV\ni+1\n(x)\n ̃\nV\ni+1\n(y)+\na\n4\n ̃\n\
            V\ni+1\n(x)\n2\n+a\n5\n ̃\nV\ni+1\n(y)\n2\n, at most 6 nonzero monomials.\
            \ The prover can then combine all the wiring pred-\nicates\n ̃\ngate\n\
            (j)\ni\n(g, x, y)for the same monomial through a summation. With this\
            \ approach, when generating\nthe proof in Algorithm 4 and 5, the prover\
            \ only allocates one array for each monomial, and initializes all 6\n\
            arrays with one scan through all the gates inInit\\_PhaseOneandInit\\\
            _PhaseTwo. In this way, the prover time\nremains the same regardless of\
            \ the number of gate types.\nIn our experiments, useful types of gates\
            \ include subtraction, relay, multiply by constant,x(1−x)for\nbinary check,NOT,AND,OR,XOR,\
            \ etc.\n2.5.1 Improvements on GKR protocols\nIn this section, we compare\

            \ circuits, proposed in \\[Tha13a\\], where the two\ninputs of a gate\
            \ can be described by two mapping functions with constant size in constant\
            \ time. See \\[Tha13a\\]\nfor the formal definition of regular circuits.\

            \ image by scaling from a high-resolution image. We use the\nclassic Lanczos\
            \ re-sampling\\[Tur90\\] method. It computes each pixel of the output\
            \ as the convolution of\nthe input with a sliding window and a kernel\
            \ function defined as:k(x) =sinc(x)/sinc(ax),if−a < x <\na;k(x) = 0,otherwise,\
            \ whereais the scaling parameter and sinc(x) =sin(x)/x. This function\
            \ is data\nparallel, where each sub-circuit computes the same function\
            \ to generate one pixel of the output image. We\nevaluate by fixing the\
            \ window size as16×16and increase the image size from 112x112 to 1072x1072.\n\
            The pixels are 8-bit integers for greyscale images.\n•Image scaling of\
            \ different parameters:It is the same computation as above with different\
            \ scaling param-\neters in the kernel function for different pixels. The\
            \ circuit of this function consists of different sub-copies.\nWe evaluate\
            \ it with the same image sizes as above.\n•Random circuit:It is randomly\
            \ generated layered circuit. We randomly sample the type of each gate,\n\
            input value and the wiring patterns. We fix the depth as 3 and increase\
            \ the number of gates per layer from\n2\n8\nto2\n20\n.\nTo be consistent\
            \ with the next section, all the protocols are executed on a 254-bit prime\
            \ field. This does not\naffect the comparison at all, as all the protocols\
            \ are in the same field. In Table 2.2, we report the prover time\nof the\
            \ protocols. The proof size and the verification time of all the variants\
            \ are similar.\nResults.As shown in Table 2.2, the performance of our\
            \ GKR protocol is comparable to those special pro-\ntocols for structured\
            \ circuits, and much better than the state-of-the-art on generic circuits.\
            \ For example, for\nmatrix multiplication, our protocol is slower by1.3-2.4×,\
            \ because the protocol in \\[Tha13a\\] writes the wiring\nof matrix multiplication\
            \ explicitly and does not need to compute\n ̃\naddand\n ̃\nmult. For image\
            \ scaling, our pro-\ntocol is slower by2.5-4×. This gap would become even\
            \ smaller when the size of each sub-copy is larger.\nHere we use a small16×16block,\
            \ while the number of copies is49-4489.\nFor image scaling with different\
            \ parameters and generic random circuits, our protocol has a speedup of\n\
            4-8×, and the speedup will increase with the scale of the circuits, as\
            \ indicated by the complexity.\nBesides the speedup on complicated circuits,\
            \ a significant advantage of our new GKR protocol is on the\nprover interface\
            \ of the system. In prior work such as \\[Wah+17; ZGKPP18\\], as the protocols\
            \ are particularly\n\n2.5. IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION42\nefficient\
            \ for structured circuits, the circuits must be represented as small copies\
            \ and the numbers of each copy.\nEven worse, the structure is explored\
            \ per layer of the circuit, making the numbers of each copy potentially\n\
            different in different layers. (E.g., 6 gates may be considered 3 copies\
            \ with 2 gates and 2 copies with 3 gates\nin two different layers for\
            \ efficiency purposes.) This constraint makes the interface of these systems\
            \ hard to\nuse and generalize. Our result gives a unified solution for\
            \ arbitrary circuits, and it is the main reason that\nour prover can take\
            \ the description of any layered arithmetic circuit potentially generated\
            \ by other tools like\nVerilog.\n2.5.2 Comparing to Other ZKP Schemes\n\

            \ the systems on three benchmarks: matrix multiplication, image scaling\
            \ and\nMerkle Tree\\[Mer87\\], which are used in \\[WTSTW18\\]. Matrix\

            \ the hash function.\nThe consistency of the input and output of corresponding\
            \ hashes are then checked by the circuit. There are\n2M−1SHA256 invocations\
            \ for a Merkle tree withMleaves. We increase the number of leaves from\

            \ Merkle trees in Figure 2.1(c). This is because (1)\nmost values in the\

            ] and real world products like Zcash \\[Ben+14\\]. There are only 26,000\
            \ constrains in one hash.\n\n2.5. IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION44\nIn\
            \ the arithmetic circuit used byLibra, there are 60,000 gates with 38,000\
            \ of them being multiplication gates.\nEven so,Librais still as fast aslibSNARKon\
            \ a Merkle tree with 2 leaves and2×faster with 256 leaves. We\nplan to\
            \ further optimize the implementation of SHA256 as an arithmetic circuit\
            \ in the future.\nThe gap betweenLibraand other systems will become bigger\
            \ as the size of the circuit grows, as the prover\ntime in these systems\
            \ (other than Bulletproof) scales quasi-linearly with the circuit size.\
            \ The evaluations\njustify that the prover time inLibrais both optimal\
            \ asymptotically, and efficient in practice.\nVerification time.Figure\
            \ 2.1(d)(e)(f) show the verification time. Our verifier is much slower\
            \ thanlibSNARK\nandlibSTARK, which runs in 1.8ms and 28-44ms respectively\
            \ in all the benchmarks.\nOther than these two systems, the verification\
            \ time ofLibrais faster, as it grows sub-linearly with the\ncircuit size.\
            \ In particular, our verification time ranges from0.08−1.15s in the benchmarks\
            \ we consider. In\nFigure 2.1(f), the verification time ofLibrais8×slower\
            \ thanAurorawhenM= 2, and15×faster when\nM= 256.Librais2.5×slower thanLigerowithM=\
            \ 2and4×faster withM= 256. Comparing toHyrax\nandBulletproof, our verification\
            \ is1.2−9×and27−900×faster respectively. Again, the gap increases\nwith\
            \ the scale of the circuits as our verification is succinct.\nProof size.We\
            \ report the proof size in Figure 2.1(g)(h)(i). Our proof size is much\
            \ bigger thanlibSNARK,\nwhich is 128 bytes for all circuits, andBulletproof,\
            \ which ranges in2-5.5KBs. The proof size inLibrais in\nthe range of 30-60KBs,\
            \ except for the matrix multiplications where it reduces to5-9KBs. This\
            \ is better than\nAurora,HyraxandlibSTARK, which also have poly-logarithmic\
            \ proof size to the circuit. Finally, the proof\nsize inLigeroisO(\n√\n\
            C)and grows to several megabytes in practice.\nSetup time.Among all the\
            \ systems, onlyLibraandlibSNARKrequire trusted setup. Thanks to the opti-\n\
            mization described in the beginning of this section, it only takes 202s\
            \ to generate the public parameters in\nour largest instance withn= 2\n\
            24\n.Libraonly needs to perform this setup once and it can be used for\
            \ all\nbenchmarks and all circuits with no more inputs.libSNARKrequires\
            \ a per-circuit setup. For example, it\ntakes 1027s for the Merkle tree\
            \ with 256 leaves, and takes 210s for\n64\n×\n64\nmatrix multiplications.\n\
            2.5.3 Discussions\nIn this section, we discuss some potential improvements\
            \ forLibra.\nImproving verification time.As shown in the experiments above,\
            \ the verification time inLibrais already\nfast in practice compared to\
            \ other systems, yet it can be further improved by 1-2 orders of magnitude.\n\
            Within the verification ofLibra, most of the time (more than 95% in the\
            \ evaluations above) is spent on\nour zkVPD protocols using bilinear pairings.\
            \ In our current protocol, we use the pairing-based zkVPD both\nfor the\
            \ input layer and for the masking polynomialsg\ni\n, R\ni\nin each intermediate\
            \ layer. Although the masking\npolynomials are small, the verification\
            \ of our zkVPD still requiresO(s\ni\n)pairings per layer forg\ni\n, which\
            \ is\nasymptotically the same as the input layer. For example, for the\
            \ SHA256 circuit with 12 layers, the zkVPD\nverification of eachg\ni\n\
            is around 46ms,\n1\n16\nof the total verification time.\nHowever, there\
            \ are many zkVPD candidates for these masking polynomials. Recall that\
            \ the size ofg\ni\nis\nonlyO(s\ni\n), logarithmic on the size of the circuit.\
            \ We could use any zkVPD with up to linear commitment size,\nprover time,\
            \ proof size and verification time while still maintaining the asymptotic\
            \ complexity ofLibra. The\nonly property we need is zero knowledge. Therefore,\
            \ we can replace our pairing-based zkVPD with any of the\nzero knowledge\
            \ proof systems we compare with as a black-box.LigeroandAuroraare of particular\
            \ interest\nas their verification requires no cryptographic operations.\
            \ If we use the black-box of these two systems for\nthe zkVPD ofg\ni\n\
            , R\ni\n, the prover time and proof size would be affected minimally,\
            \ and the verification time\n\n2.5. IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION45\n\
            would be improved by almostdtimes, as only the zkVPD of the input layer\
            \ requires pairings after the change.\nThis is a 1-2 orders-of-magnitude\
            \ improvement depending on the depth of the circuit. In addition, it also\n\
            removes the trusted setup in the zkVPD for the masking polynomials. We\
            \ plan to integrate this approach into\nour system when the implementations\
            \ ofLigeroandAurorabecome available.\nRemoving trusted setup.After the\
            \ change above, the only place that requires trusted setup is the zkVPD\
            \ for\nthe input layer. However, replacing our pairing-based zkVPD with\
            \ other systems without trusted setup may\naffect the succinctness of\
            \ our verification time on structured circuits. For example, usingLigero,Bulletproof\n\
            andAuroraas a black-box would increase the verification time toO(n), and\
            \ usingHyraxwould increase the\nproof size and verification time toO(\n\
            √\nn). UsinglibSTARKmay keep the same complexity, as polynomial\nevaluation\
            \ is a special function with short description, but the prover time and\
            \ memory usage is high in\nSTARK as shown in the experiments. Designing\
            \ an efficient zkVPD protocol with logarithmic proof size\nand verification\
            \ time without trusted setup is left as an interesting future work and\
            \ we believe this paper\nserves as an important step towards the goal\
            \ of efficient succinct zero knowledge proof without trusted setup.\n\n\
            46\nChapter 3\nOrion: Zero Knowledge Proof\nwith Linear Prover Time\n\
            Zero-knowledge proof is a powerful cryptographic primitive that has found\
            \ various applications in the real\nworld. However, existing schemes with\
            \ succinct proof size suffer from a high overhead on the proof gener-\n\
            ation time that is super-linear in the size of the statement represented\
            \ as an arithmetic circuit, limiting their\nefficiency and scalability\
            \ in practice. In this paper, we presentOrion, a new zero-knowledge argument\
            \ sys-\ntem that achievesO(N)prover time of field operations and hash\
            \ functions andO(log\n2\nN)proof size.Orion\nis concretely efficient and\
            \ our implementation shows that the prover time is 3.09s and the proof\
            \ size is 1.5MB\nfor a circuit with2\n20\nmultiplication gates. The prover\
            \ time is the fastest among all existing succinct proof\nsystems, and\
            \ the proof size is an order of magnitude smaller than a recent scheme\
            \ proposed in Golovnev et\nal. 2021.\nIn particular, we develop two new\
            \ techniques leading to the efficiency improvement. (1) We propose\na\
            \ new algorithm to test whether a random bipartite graph is a lossless\
            \ expander graph or not based on the\ndensest subgraph algorithm. It allows\
            \ us to sample lossless expanders with an overwhelming probability. The\n\
            technique improves the efficiency and/or security of all existing zero-knowledge\
            \ argument schemes with a\nlinear prover time. The testing algorithm based\

            3.1 Introduction\nZero-knowledge proof (ZKP) allows aproverto convince\
            \ averifierthat a statement is valid, without revealing\nany additional\
            \ information about the prover’s secret witness of the statement. Since\
            \ it was first introduced in\nthe seminal paper by Goldwasser, Micali\
            \ and Rackoff \\[GMR89\\], ZKP has evolved from a purely theoretical\n\
            interest to a concretely efficient cryptographic primitive, leading to\
            \ many real-world applications in prac-\ntice. It has been widely used\
            \ in blockchains and cryptocurrencies to achieve privacy (Zcash \\[Ben+14;\
            \ Zca\\])\nand to improve scalability (zkRollup \\[Zkr\\]). More recently,\
            \ it also found applications in zero-knowledge\nmachine learning \\[ZFZS20;\
            \ LKKO20; LXZ21; FQZDC21; WYXKW21\\], zero-knowledge program analy-\n\
            sis \\[FDNZ21\\], and zero-knowledge middlebox \\[GAZBW22\\].\nThere are\
            \ three major efficiency measures in ZKP: the overhead of the prover to\
            \ generate the proof, which\nis referred to as theprover time; the total\
            \ communication between the prover and the verifier, which is called\n\
            theproof size; and the time to verify the proof, which is called theverifier\
            \ time. Despite its recent progress,\nthe efficiency of ZKP is still not\
            \ good enough for many applications. In particular, the prover time is\
            \ one of\nthe major bottlenecks preventing existing ZKP schemes from scaling\
            \ to large statements. As pointed out by\nGolovnev et al. in \\[GLSTW\\\
            ], to prove a statement that can be modeled as an arithmetic circuit with\n\
            N\ngates,\nexisting schemes with succinct proof size either perform a\
            \ fast Fourier transform (FFT) due to the Reed-\nSolomon code encodings\
            \ or polynomial interpolations, or a multi-scalar exponentiation due to\
            \ the use of\ndiscrete-logarithm assumptions or bilinear maps, over a\
            \ vector of sizeO(N). The former takesO(NlogN)\nfield additions and multiplications\
            \ and the latter takesO(Nlog\\|F\\|)field multiplications, where\\|F\\\
            |is the size\nof the finite field. With the Pippenger’s algorithm \\[Pip76\\\
            ], the complexity of the multi-scalar exponentiation\ncan be improved\
            \ toO(Nlog\\|F\\|/logN), which is still super-linear aslog\\|F\\|=ω(logN)to\
            \ ensure security.\nThese operations are indeed the dominating cost of\
            \ the prover time both asymptotically and concretely. See\nSection 3.1.3\
            \ for more discussions about existing ZKP schemes categorized by the underlying\
            \ cryptographic\ntechniques.\nThe only exceptions in the literature are\
            \ schemes in \\[BCGGHJ17; BCG20; BCL22; GLSTW\\]. Bootle et\nal. \\[BCGGHJ17\\\
            ] proposed the first ZKP scheme with a prover time ofO(N)field operations\
            \ and a proof size\nofO(\n√\nN)using a linear-time encodable error-correcting\
            \ code. The proof size is later improved toO(N\n1/c\n)\nfor any constantcvia\
            \ a tensor code in \\[BCG20\\], and then topolylog(N)via a generic proof\
            \ composition with\na probabilistic checkable proof (PCP) in \\[BCL22\\\
            ]. These schemes are mainly for theoretical interests and\ndo not have\
            \ implementations with good concrete efficiency. Recently, Golovnev et\
            \ al. \\[GLSTW\\] proposed\na ZKP scheme based on the techniques in \\\
            [BCG20\\] by instantiating the linear-time encodable code with a\nrandomized\
            \ construction. However, the security guarantee (soundness error) is only\
            \ inverse polynomial in\nthe size of the circuit, instead of negligible.\
            \ Moreover, the proof size of the implemented scheme isO(\n√\nN)\n(more\
            \ details are presented in Section 3.1.3). Therefore, the following question\
            \ still remains open:\nCan we construct a concretely eﬀicient ZKP scheme\
            \ withO(N)prover time andpolylog(N)proof size?\n3.1.1 Our Contributions\n\
            We answer the question above positively in this paper by proposing a new\
            \ ZKP scheme. In particular, our\ncontributions include:\n•First, we propose\
            \ a random construction of the linear-time encodable code that has a constant\
            \ rela-\ntive distance with overwhelming probability. Such a code was\
            \ used in all existing linear-time ZKP\nschemes \\[BCGGHJ17; BCG20; BCL22;\

            •Second, we propose a new reduction that achieves a proof size ofO(log\n\
            2\nN)efficiently. Our tech-\nnique is a proof composition named “code\
            \ switching” proposed in \\[RR20\\]. We develop an efficient\ninstantiation\

            \ we implement our new ZKP scheme,Orion, and evaluate it experimentally.\
            \ On a circuit with\n2\n20\ngates (rank-1-constraint-system (R1CS) with2\n\
            20\nconstraints), the prover time is 3.09s, the proof\nsize is 1.5 MBs\
            \ and the verifier time is 70ms.Orionhas the fastest prover time among\
            \ all existing ZKP\nschemes in the literature. The proof size is 6.5×smaller\
            \ than the system in \\[GLSTW\\]. The scheme is\nplausibly post-quantum\
            \ secure and can be made non-interactive via the Fiat-Shamir heuristic\
            \ \\[FS86\\].\nTable 3.1 shows the comparison between our scheme and existing\
            \ schemes with linear prover time and suc-\ncinct proof size.\nVerifiertime.The\
            \ verifier time in Table 3.1 is achieved in the preprocessing setting\
            \ (holographic proofs \\[CHM-\\\nMVW20\\]). As all the schemes do not\
            \ have a trusted setup, their verifier time isO(N)in the worst case, as\n\
            the verifier has to read the description of the circuit/R1CS. In the preprocessing\
            \ setting, the verifier time\nbecomes sublinear with the commitment of\
            \ an indexer describing the circuit. This is the best that can be\nachieved,\
            \ and our scheme has aO(log\n2\nN)verifier time in this setting using\
            \ the techniques in \\[Set20\\]. In ad-\ndition, the scheme in \\[GLSTW\\\
            ] can also achieve a verifier time ofO(\n√\nN)in the non-preprocessing\
            \ setting\nif the circuit/R1CS is structured, i.e., the description of\
            \ the circuit can be computed in sublinear time. Our\nscheme has anO(\n\
            √\nN)verifier in this case, but notO(log\n2\nN). This is because the encoding\
            \ circuit we use\nin the proof compositing is of sizeO(\n√\nN)and is not\
            \ structured.\n\n3.1. INTRODUCTION49\nL\nR\nG’\nFigure 3.1:An example\

            \ existing ZKP schemes with linear prover time and\nsuccinct proof size\
            \ \\[BCGGHJ17; BCG20; BCL22; GLSTW\\] use linear-time encodable codes\
            \ with a con-\nstant relative distance proposed in \\[Spi96; DI14; GLSTW\\\
            ], which in turn all rely on the existence of good\nexpander graphs. In\
            \ a good expander graph, any subset of vertices expands to a large number\
            \ of neighbors.\nFigure 3.1 shows an example of a bipartite graph where\
            \ any subset of vertices on the left of size 2 expands\nto at least 5\
            \ vertices on the right. See Section 3.2.1 for formal definitions and\
            \ constructions. However, how\nto construct such good expanders remain\
            \ unclear in practice. Explicit constructions \\[CRVW02\\] have large\n\
            hidden constants in the complexity and thus are not practical. A random\
            \ graph tends to have good expansion,\nbut the probability that a random\
            \ graph is not a good expander is inverse polynomial in the size of the\
            \ graph.\nThe code constructed from a non-expanding graph does not have\
            \ a good minimum distance, making the ZKP\nscheme insecure. Therefore,\
            \ a randomly sampled graph is not good for cryptographic applications.\n\
            In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to efficiently test whether\
            \ a random graph is a good expander\nor not. With the new testing algorithm,\
            \ we are able to re-sample the random graph until it passes the test,\n\
            obtaining a good expander with an overwhelming probability and boosting\
            \ the soundness error of the ZKP\nscheme to be negligible. The testing\
            \ algorithm is based on the densest sub-graph algorithm \\[Gol84\\]. The\n\
            density of a graphG= (V, E)is defined as the number of edges divided by\
            \ the number of vertices\n\\|E\\|\n\\|V\\|\n,\nand the densest sub-graph\
            \ is simply the sub-graph in a graph with the maximum density. We observe\
            \ that\na good expander graph tends to have a small maximum density. This\
            \ is because assuming the degreegof\neach vertex is a constant, e.g.g=\
            \ 3for all vertices on the left in Figure 3.1, given any subset of vertices\
            \ of\nsizesin the graph, the total number of edges is fixed as\\|E\\|=gsin\
            \ the sub-graph defined by this subset and\nits neighbors. For example,\
            \ any two vertices on the left in Figure 3.1 as highlighted always have\
            \ 6 outgoing\nedges. Then we differentiate two cases:\n•In a good expander\
            \ graph, any subset expands to a large number of neighbors, thus the total\
            \ number\nof vertices in this sub-graph is large. Therefore, the density\
            \ of any sub-graph is small;\n•In contrast, if the graph is not a good\
            \ expander, there is at least one subset that does not expand. Taking\n\
            the sub-graph defined by this subset and its neighbors, again the number\
            \ of edges is fixed, while the\n\n3.1. INTRODUCTION50\nnumber of vertices\
            \ is small. Therefore, the density of this sub-graph is large, which will\
            \ be detected\nby the densest subgraph algorithm.\nThis observation gives\
            \ us a way to differentiate good expanders. To the best of our knowledge,\
            \ we are the\nfirst to make the connection between expander and the densest\
            \ subgraph problem.\nThe real testing algorithm involves random sampling\
            \ and repeating the densest sub-graph algorithm\nbecause of additional\
            \ conditions of the expander. The formal algorithm, theorem and proofs\
            \ are presented\nin Section 3.3.\nProof composition via code-switching.With\
            \ the expander graph sampled above and the corresponding\nlinear code,\
            \ we are able to build efficient ZKP schemes following the approaches\
            \ in \\[BCGGHJ17; BCG20;\\\nGLSTW\\]. However, the proof size isO(N\n\
            1/c\n)instead ofpolylog(N). To reduce the proof size, a common\ntechnique\
            \ in the literature is proof composition. Instead of sending the proof\
            \ directly to the verifier, the\nprover uses a second ZKP scheme to show\
            \ that the proof of the first ZKP is indeed valid. In particular,\nin\
            \ \\[BCGGHJ17; BCG20; GLSTW\\], the proof consists of several codewords\
            \ of the linear-time encodable\ncode, and the checks can be represented\
            \ as inner products between the messages in the codewords and some\npublic\
            \ vectors.\nUnfortunately, we do not have a second ZKP scheme based on\
            \ the linear-time encodable code with a\npolylog(N)proof size to prove\
            \ inner products. If we had it, we would already be able to build a ZKP\n\
            scheme withpolylog(N)proof size in the first place. Instead, we rely on\
            \ the fact that the proof consists of\nthe codewords of the linear code\
            \ and construct the second ZKP scheme as follows. One component of the\n\
            second ZKP scheme is theencoding circuitof the linear-time encodable code.\
            \ It takes the witness of the\nsecond ZKP scheme, encodes it and outputs\
            \ several random locations of the codeword. The verifier checks\nthat\
            \ these random locations are the same as the proof of the first ZKP scheme,\
            \ without receiving the entire\nproof. By the distance of the linear-time\
            \ encodable code, we show that the witness of the second ZKP must\nbe\
            \ the same as the message in the proof of the first ZKP with overwhelming\
            \ probability. After that, the other\ncomponent of the second ZKP checks\
            \ the inner product relationship modeled as an arithmetic circuit. A\n\
            similar proof composition was also used in \\[RR20\\]. We view our approach\
            \ using the encoding circuit as a\nvariant of the proof composition that\
            \ is efficient in practice, and thus we inherit the name “code switching”\n\
            from \\[RR20\\].\nWith this idea, we can use any general-purpose ZKP scheme\
            \ on arithmetic circuits with apolylog(N)\nproof size as the second ZKP\
            \ scheme in the proof composition. The size of this circuit is onlyO(\n\
            √\nN), thus\nthe second ZKP does not introduce any overhead on the prover\
            \ time as long as its prover time is no more than\nquadratic. In our construction,\
            \ we use the ZKP scheme in \\[ZXZS20\\] as the second ZKP. The scheme\
            \ is based\non the interactive oracle proofs (IOP) and the witness is\
            \ encoded using the Reed-Solomon code. Therefore,\nthe technique is called\
            \ code switching. The formal protocols are presented in Section 2.4.\n\

            \ time super-\nlinear in the size of the circuit.\nWith the techniques\
            \ proposed in \\[XZZPS19c; Zha+21a\\], the prover time of the schemes\
            \ based on the\ninteractive proofs (the GKR protocol \\[GKR08\\]) is linear\
            \ if the size of the input is significantly smaller than\nthe size of\

            \ strictly linear without such\na requirement, and our polynomial commitment\
            \ scheme can also be plugged into these schemes to improve\ntheir efficiency.\n\

            \ BCG20; BCL22; GLSTW\\]\nare the only candidates in the literature with\
            \ linear prover time and succinct proof size for arithmetic circuits.\n\
            They all use linear-time encodable codes based on expander graphs and\
            \ our first contribution applies to all of\nthem. Moreover, our ZKP scheme\
            \ is based on the polynomial commitment in \\[GLSTW\\] and the tensor\

            \ a proof composition with the PCP in \\[Mie09\\]. However, the complexity\

            3.3 Testing Algorithm for Lossless Expander\nAs explained above, the generalized\
            \ Spielman code relies on the existence of lossless expanders. On one\n\
            hand, there are explicit constructions of lossless expanders in the literature\
            \ \\[CRVW02\\]. However, there are\nlarge hidden constants in the complexity\
            \ and the constructions are not practical. On the other hand, a random\n\
            bipartite graph is a lossless expander with a high probability of1−O(\n\
            1\npoly(k)\n), wherekis the size of the left\nvertex set in the bipartite\
            \ graph. However, this is not good enough for cryptographic applications.\n\
            In this section, we propose a new approach to sample a lossless expander\
            \ with a negligible failure prob-\nability. The key ingredient of our\
            \ approach is a new algorithm to test whether a randomly sampled bipartite\n\
            graph is a lossless expander or not. We begin the section by introducing\
            \ the classical randomized construction\nof a lossless expander and its\
            \ analysis.\n3.3.1 Random Construction of Lossless Expander\nAs defined\
            \ in Definition 3.2.2, a lossless expander graph is ag-left-regular bipartite\
            \ graphG= (L, R, E).\nWigderson et al. \\[HLW06, Lemma1.9\\] showed that\
            \ a random bipartite graph is a lossless expander with a\nhigh probability.\
            \ In particular, we have the following lemma:\nLemma 3.3.1(\\[HLW06\\\
            ]).For fixed constant parametersg, δ, α, ε, a randomg-left-regular bipartite\
            \ graph\nis a(k, k\n′\n;g)-lossless-expander with probability1−O(\n1\n\
            poly(k)\n).\nProof.LetG= (L, R, E)be a random bipartite graph withkvertices\
            \ on the left andk\n′\n=O(k)vertices\non the right, where each left vertex\
            \ connects to a randomly chosen set ofgvertices on the right.\nLets=\\\
            |S\\|be the cardinality of a left subset of verticesS⊆Lsuch thats≤\nδk\n\
            g\n, and lett=\\|T\\|be the\ncardinality of a right subset of verticesT⊆Rsuch\
            \ thatt≤(1−ε)gs. LetX\nS,T\nbe an indicator random\nvariable for the event\
            \ that all the edges fromSconnect toT. Then for a particularS, if\n∑\n\
            T∈R\nX\nS,T\n= 0,\nthen the number of neighboring vertices ofSmust be\
            \ larger than(1−ε)gs. Otherwise, if there exists a\nT∈Rsuch thatX\nS,T\n\
            = 1, i.e., all edges fromSconnect toT, the graph is not a lossless expander.\
            \ As the\nedges are sampled randomly, the probability of thisnon-expandingevent\
            \ is(\nt\nk\n′\n)\nsg\n. Therefore, summing over\nallSand by the union\

            \ case of lossless expander where\nk\n′\n=O(k). Now we show that the density\
            \ of a perfect expander is low:\nTheorem 3.3.6.If a bipartite graph is\
            \ a perfect expander, its density is at most\ng\n1+(1−ε)g\n; otherwise,\
            \ the\ndensity of the graph is larger than\ng\n1+(1−ε)g\n.\nProof.We first\
            \ show that the density of a perfect expander is at most\ng\n1+(1−ε)g\n\
            . For any subsetL\n′\n⊆L,\nwe prove that among all sub-graphs thatL\n\
            ′\nis the left vertex set, the graph induced by(L\n′\n,Γ(L\n′\n))has the\n\
            maximum density.\nTo see this, supposeV\n′\n= (L\n′\n, R\n′\n), R\n′\n\
            ̸= Γ(L\n′\n)has density\n\\|E\n′\n\\|\n\\|V\n′\n\\|\nthat is the densest\

            \ a vertexy∈R\n′\n, y /∈Γ(L\n′\n), then there is no edge betweenyandL\n\
            ′\n. We can increase\nthe density by removingyfromR\n′\n, as\n\\|E\n′\n\
            \\|\n\\|V\n′\n\\|−1\n>\n\\|E\n′\n\\|\n\\|V\n′\n\\|\n. This is a contradiction.\
            \ Therefore,R\n′\n⊆Γ(L\n′\n).\nCase 2: If there exists an elementy∈Γ(L\n\
            ′\n), y̸∈R\n′\n, letc≥1be the number of edges betweenyandL\n′\n,\nby addingytoR\n\
            ′\n, the density becomes\n\\|E\n′\n\\|+c\n\\|V\n′\n\\|+1\n>\n\\|E\n′\n\
            \\|\n\\|V\n′\n\\|\n. This is a contradiction again and thusΓ(L\n′\n)⊆R\n\
            ′\n.\nTherefore, we haveΓ(L\n′\n) =R\n′\nandV\n′\n= (L\n′\n,Γ(L\n′\n))maximizes\
            \ the density among all sub-graphs with\nL\n′\nas the left vertex set.\
            \ Let that sub-graph beG\n′\n. By the expansion property of the perfect\

            Next, we show that if a bipartite graph is not a perfect expander, its\
            \ density is larger than\ng\n1+(1−ε)g\n. LetS\n∗\nbe the set such that\\\

            \ cannot directly apply the densest sub-graph algorithm on the entire\n\

            γ\n0\n, and this step is referred to as\nthe “fold” operation in \\[BCG20\\\
            ]. Second, the prover shows thatc\nγ\n0\nis indeed computed from the committed\n\
            tensor codeword. To do so, the verifier randomly selectstcolumns and the\
            \ prover opens them with their\nMerkle tree proofs. The verifier checks\
            \ that the inner product between each column and the random vector\nγ\n\
            0\nis equal to the corresponding element ofc\nγ\n0\n(Step 15). As shown\
            \ in \\[BCGGHJ17; BCG20\\], if the linear\ncode has a constant relative\
            \ distance, the committed matrix is close to a tensor codeword with overwhelming\n\
            probability.\nConsistency check.The consistency check follows exactly\
            \ the same steps of the proximity check. Instead of\nusing a random vector\
            \ from the verifier, the linear combination is done withr\n0\nof the tensor\
            \ queryr\n0\n⊗r\n1\n.\nSimilarly,c\n1\nis a codeword of the linear code\
            \ with messagey\n1\n, andφ(x) =⟨y\n1\n, r\n1\n⟩by the definition of tensor\n\
            product and polynomial evaluation. As shown in \\[BCG20\\], by the check\
            \ in Step 16, if the committed matrix\ninRis close to a tensor codeword,\
            \ theny=φ(x)with overwhelming probability. In particular, there exist\n\

            \ Eﬀicient Proof Composition via Code Switching\nThe proof size of the\
            \ polynomial commitment in Protocol 9 isO(\n√\nN)(the complexity hides\
            \ a security pa-\nrametert). There are three steps that incurO(\n√\nN)proof\
            \ size in Protocol 9: Step 8, 9, and 13. In this section,\nwe present\
            \ a new protocol that reduces the proof size toO(log\n2\nN)via the technique\
            \ of proof composition.\nThe idea is to use a second proof system to prove\
            \ that the checks of these three steps are satisfied, without\nsending\
            \ the proofs of these steps to the verifier directly.\nTo design the second\
            \ proof system efficiently, our key observation is that the values sent\
            \ by the prover in\nthese three steps are messages of the linear-time\
            \ encodable code. That is,y\nγ\n0\nis the message ofc\nγ\n0\nin Step 8,\n\
            y\n1\nis the message ofc\n1\nin Step 9 andC\n1\n\\[:,idx\\]is the message\
            \ ofC\n2\n\\[:,idx\\]for everyidxin Step 13. Therefore,\nthe second proof\
            \ system takesy\nγ\n0\n, y\n1\nandC\n1\n\\[:,idx\\]foridx∈Ias the witness,\
            \ and performs the following\ncomputations:\n1.It encodes the witness\
            \ using the encoding circuit of the linear-time encodable code.\n2.It\
            \ outputs a subset of random indices of the codewords chosen by the verifier.\
            \ By checking whether\nthe values of these indices are consistent with\
            \ the commitments by the prover via the Merkle tree, it\nguarantees that\
            \ the witness is indeed the same as the messages specified above with\
            \ overwhelming\nprobability because of the minimum distance property of\
            \ the code.\n3.Finally, it checks that these messages and their codewords\
            \ satisfy the conditions in line 15, 16 and 17\nof Protocol 9.\nThe idea\
            \ is illustrated in Figure 3.2, and we formally present the statement\
            \ of the second proof system in\nProtocol 10. Note that\nˆ\nIis the random\

            \ for the code switching. In this\nway, we switch the message encoded\
            \ using the linear-time encodable code to the witness of the second proof\n\
            system. In our implementation, we are using an IOP-based zero-knowledge\

            \ efficient instantiation of the “code switching” technique in \\[RR20\\\

            \ protocol in Protocol 11 and highlight the differences from Protocol\

            \nSettings and parameters.Our polynomial commitment scheme is implemented\
            \ in C++ with 6000 lines of\\\ncode. The proof composition uses Virgo\
            \ in \\[ZXZS20\\] and its open-source implementation. We combine\\\nthe\
            \ polynomial commitment with a sumcheck protocol to get our zero-knowledge\
            \ argument following the\\\napproach in \\[Set20\\] and we implement our\
            \ own code for this part.\\\nExpander graph used in our implementationWe\
            \ use a modified version of generalized Spielman code in\\\n\\[GLSTW\\\
            ]. The code assigns a random weight to each edge of the expander graph,\
            \ achieving a better min-\\\nimum distance. We take a step further and\
            \ fine-tune the dimensions more aggressively. With our testing\\\nalgorithm,\
            \ the failure probability of the expander sampling remains negligible.\
            \ There are two types of ex-\\\npander graph used in our construction\
            \ and the parameters areG\\\n1\\\n:α= 0.33, δ= 0.6, ε= 0.78, g= 6;G\\\n\

            \n3.5.1 Expander Testing\\\nWe first show the performance of our expander\
            \ testing algorithm in Section 3.3. We implemented the densest\\\nsub-graph\
            \ algorithm in \\[Gol84\\], which uses network-flow algorithm as a black-box.\
            \ In our implementation,\\\nwe use Dinic’s algorithm \\[Din70\\], the\
            \ complexity of which isO(\\|V\\|\\\n2\\\n\\|E\\|)on general graphs. However,\
            \ on\\\nrandom bipartite graphs, the Dinic’s algorithm runs significantly\
            \ faster. As observed in our experiments, it\\\nscales almost linearly\
            \ in the size of the graph.\\\nFigure 3.3 shows the running time of the\
            \ algorithm. We vary the size of left vertex setLin the random\\\nbipartite\
            \ graph from2\\\n12\\\nto2\\\n18\\\n, and the size ofRis set to be\\|L\\\
            |×α. The implementation uses multi-threading\\\nutilizing all128CPU cores.\
            \ As shown in the figure, it only takes 163 seconds to test whether a\
            \ random\\\nbipartite graph with\\|L\\|= 2\\\n15\\\nvertices is a lossless\
            \ expander with a failure probabilitynegl(N) = 2\\\n−128\\\n.\\\nThe running\
            \ time almost grows linearly in\\|L\\|. Ask=\\\n√\\\nNin our zero-knowledge\
            \ argument, this is enough\\\nfor our experiments. As the sampling of\
            \ the lossless expander is done once, our testing algorithm is very\\\n\
            practical.\\\n3.5.2 Polynomial Commitment\\\nIn this section, we report\
            \ the performance of our polynomial commitment scheme and compare it with\
            \ the\\\nschemeBrakedownin \\[GLSTW\\], which is the only implemented\
            \ polynomial commitment scheme with a lin-\\\near prover time. We use\
            \ the open-source implementation ofBrakedownat \\[Wa\\] in the comparison.\
            \ Our cur-\\\nrent implementation is for the plain version of the polynomial\
            \ commitment without zero-knowledge, which\\\nis the same asBrakedown.\\\
            \nFigure 3.4 shows the performance of our polynomial commitment and the\
            \ polynomial commitment in\\\nBrakedown. We vary the size of the polynomials\
            \ from2\\\n15\\\nto2\\\n29\\\nand measure the prover time, the proof\\\
            \nsize and the verifier time. As shown in the figure, our prover time\
            \ is even slightly faster thanBrakedown.\\\nIt only takes 115 seconds\
            \ for a polynomial with2\\\n27\\\ncoefficients, while it is 132 seconds\
            \ inBrakedown.\\\nThis is because we use more aggressive parameters of\
            \ the expander code, while still achieving 128-bit of\\\nsecurity thanks\
            \ to our expander testing algorithm. Moreover, the additional proof composition\
            \ in our scheme\\\ninvolves a second zero-knowledge argument on a circuit\
            \ of sizeO(\\\n√\\\nN). In our experiments, this extra zero-\\\nknowledge\
            \ argument takes less than 20% of the total prover time, justifying that\
            \ our code switching technique\\\nonly introduces a small overhead on\
            \ the prover time.\\\n\\\n3.5. EXPERIMENTS69\\\n2\\\n13\\\n2\\\n15\\\n\

            \n27\\\n, 16×smaller thanBrakedown. The verifier time is 70ms forN= 2\\\

            \ of theO(log\\\n2\\\nN)proof size and verifier\\\ntime in our scheme.\\\
            \nNote that there is a jump fromN= 2\\\n21\\\ntoN= 2\\\n23\\\nin the proof\
            \ size and verifier time. This is because\\\nin our implementation, instead\
            \ of directly parsing the coefficients into\\\n√\\\nN×\\\n√\\\nNmatrix,\
            \ we optimize\\\nthe dimensions for better performance. WhenN <2\\\n23\\\
            \n, it is not meaningful to do code-switching on the\\\ncolumns. The prover\
            \ only does the code-switching on the row (Protocol 11 Step 8 and 9),\
            \ but opens the\\\ncolumns directly. We observe that this gives the best\
            \ prover time and the proof size. WhenN≥2\\\n23\\\n, the\\\nprover does\
            \ the code-switching for both the row and the columns (Protocol 11, Step\
            \ 8–13). Therefore, the\\\nproof size and the verifier time have a big\
            \ increase because of the larger column size and the additional\\\ncode-switching\
            \ protocol.\\\n3.5.3 Zero-knowledge Arguments\\\nFinally, we present the\
            \ performance of our zero-knowledege argument scheme for R1CS as a whole\
            \ in this\\\nsection. We focus the comparison to existing schemes that\
            \ work on R1CS and have transparent setup\\\nand plausible post-quantum\
            \ security. They includeBrakedown\\[GLSTW\\],Aurora\\[BSCRSVW19\\] and\\\

            ], and the open-source code ofLigero\\\nandAuroraat \\[Aur\\] in the experiments.\\\
            \nWe randomly generate the R1CS instances and vary the number of constraints\
            \ from2\\\n15\\\nto2\\\n20\\\n. As shown\\\nin Figure 3.5,Orionhas the\

            \ of the linear prover time and the simplified\\\nreduction via polynomial\

            \ It is only 1.5 MB forN=\\\n2\\\n20\\\n, 6.5×smaller thanBrakedownand\
            \ 12.5×smaller thanLigero. The proof size is even comparable to\\\nAurora,\

            \ a much better minimum\\\ndistance than our linear code. The result justifies\
            \ the improvement of our code switching.\\\nWe only implemented and compared\
            \ with the variants of the protocols with a linear verifier time. As\\\
            \nexplained in the introduction, the verifier time of all schemes grow\
            \ linearly withNin the worst case, and the\\\ncomparisons are similar\
            \ to the prover time. One can reduce the verifier time to sublinear in\
            \ the holographic\\\nsetting using the techniques in \\[CHMMVW20; COS20;\

            \ via Fully\\\nDistributed Zero-Knowledge Proofs\\\nIn the past decade,\
            \ blockchains have seen various financial and technological innovations,\
            \ with cryptocurren-\\\ncies reaching a market cap of over 1 trillion\
            \ dollars. However, scalability is one of the key issues hindering the\\\
            \ndeployment of blockchains in many applications. To improve the throughput\
            \ of the transactions, zkRollups\\\nand zkEVM techniques using the cryptographic\
            \ primitive of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) have been pro-\\\nposed and\
            \ many companies are adopting these technologies in the layer-2 solutions.\
            \ However, in these\\\ntechnologies, the proof generation of the ZKP is\
            \ the bottleneck and the companies have to deploy powerful\\\nmachines\
            \ with TBs of memory to batch a large number of transactions in a ZKP.\\\
            \nIn this work, we improve the scalability of these techniques by proposing\
            \ new schemes of fully distributed\\\nZKPs. Our schemes can improve the\
            \ efficiency and the scalability of ZKPs using multiple machines, while\
            \ the\\\ncommunication among the machines is minimal. With our schemes,\
            \ the ZKP generation can be distributed\\\nto multiple participants in\
            \ a model similar to the mining pools. Our protocols are based on Plonk,\
            \ an efficient\\\nzero-knowledge proof system with a universal trusted\
            \ setup. The first protocol is for data-parallel circuits. For\\\ncomputation\
            \ ofMsub-circuits of sizeTeach, usingMmachines, the prover time isO(TlogT+MlogM),\\\
            \nwhile the prover time of the original Plonk on a single machine isO(M\
            \ Tlog(M T)). Our protocol incurs only\\\nO(1)communication per machine,\
            \ and the proof size and verifier time are bothO(1), the same as the original\\\
            \nPlonk. Moreover, we show that with minor modifications, our second protocol\
            \ can support general circuits\\\nwith arbitrary connections while preserving\
            \ the same proving, verifying, and communication complexity.\\\nWe implementPianist(Plonk\
            \ vIA uNlimited dISTribution), a fully distributed ZKP system using our\\\
            \nprotocols.Pianistcan generate the proof for 8192 transactions in 313\
            \ seconds on 64 machines. This improves\\\nthe scalability of the Plonk\
            \ scheme by 64×. The communication per machine is only 2.1 KB, regardless\
            \ of\\\nthe number of machines and the size of the circuit. The proof\
            \ size is 2.2 KB and the verifier time is 3.5 ms.\\\nWe further show thatPianisthas\
            \ similar improvements for general circuits. On a randomly generated circuit\\\
            \nwith2\\\n25\\\ngates, it only takes 5s to generate the proof using 32\
            \ machines,24.2×faster than Plonk on a single\\\nmachine.\\\n\\\n4.1.\
            \ INTRODUCTION76\\\n4.1 Introduction\\\nBlockchain technology has paved\
            \ the way for innovative services such as decentralized finance, NFTs,\
            \ and\\\nGameFi. The cryptocurrency market has experienced significant\
            \ growth, surpassing 1 trillion USD in value\\\nsince Bitcoin’s inception\
            \ 13 years ago \\[Coi\\]. Techniques like zkRollups and zkEVM have been\
            \ proposed\\\nto boost blockchain efficiency and bridge the transaction\
            \ throughput gap between digital and traditional sce-\\\nnarios. Implementing\
            \ zkRollups could potentially increase transaction throughput by over\
            \ 100 times, as esti-\\\nmated by Vitalik Buterin \\[Vit\\]. Numerous\
            \ companies have incorporated these techniques into their products,\\\n\
            including zkSync \\[Zks\\], Starkware \\[Sta\\], Hermez \\[Her\\], Aztec\
            \ \\[Azt\\], Scroll \\[Scr\\], and others.\\\nzkRollups and zkEVM rely\
            \ on zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), a cryptographic primitive that allows\
            \ a\\\nprover to convince a verifier the correctness of computations.\
            \ More specifically, they use Zero-Knowledge\\\nSuccinct Non-interactive\
            \ Argument of Knowledge (ZK-SNARK) systems, which ensures that the proof\
            \ size\\\nis significantly smaller than the size of computation and enables\
            \ faster validation. By utilizing ZKPs, a single\\\nserver can validate\
            \ multiple transactions, compute state transitions, and generate a proof\
            \ that is posted on the\\\nblockchain. Instead of re-executing all transactions,\
            \ nodes can verify transactions and smart contracts by\\\nchecking the\
            \ proof and updating their status. This approach greatly increases the\
            \ transaction throughput of\\\nthe blockchain.\\\nHowever, the proof generation\
            \ remains a significant bottleneck for existing ZKP schemes when applied\\\
            \nto large-scale statements such as zkRollups and zkEVM. For instance,\
            \ our experiments show that the Plonk\\\nsystem \\[GWC19b\\], a widely-used\
            \ ZKP protocol in the industry, can only scale to a circuit with2\\\n\
            25\\\ngates\\\non a machine with200GB of memory. As a result, companies\
            \ like Starkware \\[Sta\\] and Scroll \\[Scr\\] must\\\ndeploy powerful\
            \ clusters with terabytes of memory to generate proofs for zkRollups and\
            \ zkEVM. In this\\\npaper, we tackle this issue by proposing fully distributed\
            \ ZKP schemes that enhance both efficiency and\\\nscalability through\
            \ distributed proof generation across multiple machines. Crucially, our\
            \ schemes require\\\nminimal communication among machines, with each machine\
            \ only exchanging a constant number of values\\\nwith the master machine.\
            \ This approach allows us to distribute ZKP generation in zkRollups and\
            \ zkEVM\\\namong multiple participants, in a similar model to existing\
            \ mining pools. More transactions can be batched\\\ninto a single ZKP\
            \ within a fixed period, without necessitating participants to stay online\
            \ and communicate\\\nwith each other with high overhead. Participants\
            \ can potentially share the reward for generating the ZKP,\\\nakin to\
            \ miners in current proof-of-work blockchains. Furthermore, our scheme\
            \ can be generalized to create\\\nproofs for arbitrary general circuits,\
            \ leading us to the name “fully distributed ZKPs”.\\\nOur distributed\
            \ schemes are built upon Plonk \\[GWC19b\\]. Instead of using univariate\
            \ polynomials to\\\nrepresent the constraints of a computation, we devise\
            \ a protocol based on a bivariate constraint system. First,\\\nwe claim\
            \ that this protocol can cater to data-parallel circuits, allowing each\
            \ machine to generate the witness\\\nfor its corresponding sub-circuit.\
            \ Second, we further generalize it to compute proofs for general circuits\\\
            \nwith aribitrary connections, assuming the witness has already been distributed\
            \ among the machines. In both\\\ncases, our schemes demonstrate that the\
            \ efficiency and scalability can be improved by a factor ofMusing\\\n\
            Mmachines, the proof size remainsO(1), and the communication complexity\
            \ per machine is onlyO(1).\\\nOur contributions.We have the following\
            \ contributions:\\\n•We propose two fully distributed ZKP protocols for\
            \ data-parallel circuits and general circuits, respectively.\\\nTo construct\
            \ the schemes, we first propose a distributed polynomial interactive oracle\
            \ proof (polynomial\\\nIOP) and then combine it with a polynomial commitment\
            \ scheme (PCS) that is distributively computable\\\nas well. The polynomial\
            \ IOP is a bivariate variant of Plonk’s \\[GWC19b\\] constraint system.\
            \ To “compile”\\\nboth IOP schemes by polynomial commitments, we use the\
            \ bivariate variant of the KZG \\[PST13\\] scheme\\\n\\\n4.1. INTRODUCTION77\\\
            \nand demonstrate that it is distributively computable. The use of the\
            \ Lagrange polynomial in our scheme is\\\ninspired by a sub-scheme in\
            \ Caulk \\[ZBKMNS22\\].\\\n•We further show that our protocols are robust\
            \ in the presence of malicious machines. We formalize the\\\nnotion asRobust\
            \ Collaborative Proving Scheme(RCPS), for the collaborative generation\
            \ of proofs among\\\nsub-provers in a malicious environment. In this setting,\
            \ the master node is able to verify partial proofs\\\nand messages received\
            \ from other machines before aggregating them to compute the final proof.\
            \ We show\\\nthat our protocols are robust under this definition with\
            \ an additional step of verification. This property is\\\ncrucial for\
            \ the applications of distributed zkRollups and zkEVM to exclude malicious\
            \ participants without\\\nruining the distributed proof generation.\\\n\
            •We implement the fully distributed ZKP system,Pianist, for both data-parallel\
            \ and general circuits. For the\\\ndata-parallel version, we report experimental\
            \ results for the blockchain application of zkRollups. Utilizing\\\nrollup\
            \ circuits generated by the Circom compiler \\[Cira\\], we show thatPianistcan\
            \ scale to 8192 transactions\\\non 64 machines with a prover time of 313\
            \ seconds. In comparison, the original Plonk scheme can only\\\nscale\
            \ to 32 transactions with a prover time of 95 seconds on a single machine.\
            \ The communication between\\\neach machine and the master machine is\
            \ only 2144 bytes, and the proof size is 2208 bytes. We observe\\\nsimilar\
            \ improvements for general circuits. On a circuit of size2\\\n25\\\n,\
            \ it only takes 5s to generate the proof\\\nusing 32 machines, which is24.2×faster\
            \ than Plonk on a single machine, with 2336 Bytes communication\\\nand\
            \ 2816 Bytes proof size.\\\nOrganization of the paper.We review the related\
            \ work in Section 4.1.1 and present the preliminaries in\\\nSection 4.2.\
            \ To explain our protocols, we first introduce our distributed polynomial\
            \ IOP schemes in Sec-\\\ntion 4.3 for data-parallel circuits and general\
            \ circuits. Then in Section 4.4, we present a bivariate variant of\\\n\
            the polynomial commitment in \\[KZG; PST13\\] to compile our polynomial\
            \ IOP schemes to SNARKs. In Sec-\\\ntion 4.5, we formalize the notion\
            \ of robust collaborative proving scheme (RCPS) and show that our scheme\\\
            \nis able to detect malicious machines. We showcase the performance of\
            \ our system in Section 4.6, and present\\\nadditional discussions in\
            \ Section 4.7.\\\n4.1.1 Related works\\\nZero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) were\
            \ first introduced by Goldwasser, Micali, and Rackoff in their seminal\\\
            \npaper \\[GMR\\]. Driven by real-world applications such as blockchains\
            \ \\[Ben+14; KMSWP; Xie+22\\], there\\\nhas been a rapid development of\
            \ efficient zkSNARK systems in recent years \\[PHGR13; BSCTV14c; Gro16;\\\
            \nWTSTW18; ZGKPP17a; BSBHR19; BBBPWM18; AHIV17; BSCRSVW19; XZZPS19c; CHMMVW20;\\\
            \nGWC19b; Set20; ZXZS20; Zha+21b\\]. Despite such progress, it remains\
            \ challenging to scale ZKP protocols\\\nto large statements due to their\
            \ high overhead on the prover running time and memory usage.\\\nDistributed\
            \ ZKPs.To scale existing ZKP protocols to large-scale circuits, distributed\
            \ algorithms provide\\\na promising direction. Wu et al. proposed the\
            \ first distributed zero-knowledge proof protocol called DIZK\\\nin \\\
            [WZCPS18\\]. DIZK scales the pairing-based zkSNARK in \\[Gro16\\] to handle\
            \ circuits that are 100 times\\\nlarger on 128 machines compared to a\
            \ single machine. However, DIZK incurs a high communication cost\\\nthat\
            \ is linear in the total size of the circuit among different machines\
            \ because the scheme runs a distributed\\\nnumber theoretic transformation\
            \ (NTT) algorithm among the machines using the Map-Reduce framework.\\\
            \nAdditionally, the recent work of zkBridge \\[Xie+22\\] proposed deVirgo,\
            \ a distributed ZKP protocol based on\\\nthe ZKP scheme in \\[ZXZS20\\\
            ], to build bridges between two blockchains using ZKPs. The protocol achieves\\\
            \n\\\n4.1. INTRODUCTION78\\\nlinear improvement on both the prover time\
            \ and scalability in the number of machines. However, deVirgo\\\nalso\
            \ incurs a linear communication cost among the machines, and the proof\
            \ size grows with the number of\\\nmachines. This seems inevitable due\
            \ to the use of the FRI protocol in \\[BSBHR18\\] with Merkle trees \\\
            [Mer87\\].\\\nBy contrast, our schemes offer optimal linear scalability\
            \ in prover time and minimal communication among\\\ndistributed machines\
            \ simultaneously. We provide comparisons in Table 4.1.\\\nPCD and IVCProof-Carrying\
            \ Data(PCD \\[CT10; BCCT13\\]) is a cryptographic technique that breaks\
            \ down\\\ncomputation into a sequence of steps. In each step, the prover\
            \ convinces the verifier not only of the current\\\nstep’s correctness\
            \ but also of all previous steps. It is an alternative solution for data-parallel\
            \ circuits when\\\nmemory is limited. There are generally two ways to\
            \ achieve PCD: one is from succinct verification, and\\\nthe other is\
            \ from accumulation. In the succinct verification approach, for each step,\
            \ the prover generates\\\na proof for the current step computation and\
            \ verification for the proof generated from the previous step,\\\nas seen\
            \ in\\[BCCT13; BSCTV14b; COS20\\], etc. The accumulation approach postpones\
            \ and accumulates\\\nthe verification of SNARK proofs (or some expensive\
            \ part of it) at each recursion step and proves it all\\\nat once at the\
            \ last step, as demonstrated in \\[BCMS20; Hal; BCLMS20; KST22; KS22\\\
            ], etc. Although\\\nthere is no direct correspondence for general circuits,\
            \ some of these techniques, including but not limited\\\nto \\[KST22;\
            \ KS22\\], claim to achieveIncremental Verifiable Computation(IVC). IVC\
            \ focuses on dividing long-\\\nrunning computations into stages that can\
            \ be verified incrementally. For instance, Nova \\[KST22\\] supports\\\
            \nproof generation when the computation involves a nondeterministic functionfand\
            \ the result off\\\nn\\\n(z\\\n0\\\n).\\\nThese techniques are widely\
            \ employed in various applications, however, we identify several drawbacks\
            \ when\\\ncompared to our proposed solution. See details in Section 4.7.\\\
            \nDistributed computation from proof aggregationSimilar to our approach,\
            \ aPlonk \\[ABST22\\] is a dis-\\\ntributed solution based on Plonk that\
            \ requires prover nodes to share the same Fiat-Shamir randomness, ne-\\\

            \ In their scheme, they propose a multi-\\\npolynomial commitment to combine\
            \ parties’ polynomial commitments and attest to the batch opening using\\\
            \na generalizedInner-Product Argument(IPA) from \\[BMV19\\]. Additionally,\

            \ with bivariate KZG\\\nand provide a detailed analysis of proving time,\
            \ verification time, proof size, and communication complexity.\\\nBefore\
            \ diving into the details, we first explain our intuition. We opt for\
            \ the distributed system to avoid\\\nthe substantial overhead introduced\
            \ by recursive proof (see Section 4.7 for a detailed discussion). PCD-\\\
            \nand-IVC-based solutions rely on recursive proofs because they handle\
            \ each sub-circuit in a separate proof\\\nwaiting to be aggregated. Instead,\
            \ we treat all sub-circuits as a whole and exploit the succinctness of\
            \ SNARK,\\\nresulting in a small proof size and verification time. However,\
            \ DIZK \\[WZCPS18\\] shows that directly applying\\\ndistribution techniques\
            \ to the original univariate SNARK system leads to linear communication\
            \ costs due to\\\nthe significantly interleaving network required to run\
            \ the NTT algorithm. Taking both hazards into account,\\\nwe propose a\
            \ solution leveraging bivariate polynomial constraints to both ”split”\
            \ the NTT instances, avoiding\\\nsubstantial communication, and ”combine”\
            \ the proof for each sub-circuit as a whole, eliminating the need\\\n\
            for expensive aggregation costs. The details are as follows.\\\n4.3.1\
            \ Arithmetic Constraint System for Each Party\\\nOur constraint system\
            \ inherits the original Plonk \\[GWC19b\\]. The original Plonk works for\
            \ a fan-in-two\\\narithmetic circuit, where each gate takes at most two\
            \ inputs. In Plonk, the left input, the right input, and\\\nthe output\
            \ of each gate are encoded by three univariate polynomials respectively.\
            \ The verifier can check the\\\ncomputation of each gate by a polynomial\
            \ equation, which we refer to as thegate constraint. Additionally, the\\\
            \nverifier also checks that the input and output of the gates are connected\
            \ correctly as defined by the structure\\\nof the circuit, which we refer\
            \ to as thecopy constraint.\\\nGate ConstraintFor thei-th party, leta\\\

            \ and remain the constraint structure. Inheriting the general-purpose\

            \ a constraint system proving data-parallel circuits but also for a\\\n\
            more general case: we allow the sub-circuits to be different.\\\nIntuitively,\
            \ we can use the powers of another variableYto randomly combine the polynomials\

            \ a sub-scheme in the recent work Caulk \\[ZBKMNS22\\]. In partic-\\\n\

            \nA sketch of the distributed IOP for the previous system.In Protocol\
            \ 3, we introduce the polynomial\\\nIOP protocol for the previous constraint\
            \ system (excluding the orange characters). From this protocol, we\\\n\
            observe that, aside from sending and assisting the verifier with querying\
            \ the polynomial oracles, the prover\\\nonly needs to distributively maintain\
            \ each oracle. We will later prove that this property is sufficient to\
            \ con-\\\nstruct a distributed SNARK proof generation. We also observe\
            \ that this property trivially holds for all poly-\\\nnomials exceptH\\\
            \nY\\\n(Y, X). To circumvent this obstacle, the prover receives an opening\
            \ pointαfrom the\\\nverifier and only sends the univariate oracleH\\\n\
            Y\\\n(Y, α). We claim that after this modification, the protocol\\\nremains\
            \ knowledge-sound and can be distributively computed. For simplicity,\
            \ we provide the strict proof in\\\nSection 4.3.4 after explaining the\
            \ system for general circuits.\\\nRemark 4.3.1.For the witness generation,\
            \ since all sub-circuits are separated, each party can generate its\\\n\
            witness locally.\\\nRemark 4.3.2.Although we assume the sub-circuits are\
            \ independent of each other, it is easy to observe\\\nthat if we introduce\
            \ custom gates and rotation along with the variableY, then we can support\
            \ some simple\\\nconnections among different sub-circuits. In addition,\
            \ we can also introduce local lookup arguments in our\\\nconstraint system.\
            \ Further discussion on custom gates and lookup arguments are in Section\
            \ 4.7.\\\n4.3.3 Constraint System for General Circuit\\\nIn this section,\
            \ we show the great potential of our system by generalizing it to generate\
            \ proofs for arbitrary\\\ncircuits. Recall that in the original Plonk,\
            \ it leveragesσ\\\na\\\n(X),σ\\\nb\\\n(X), andσ\\\nc\\\n(X)to navigate\
            \ the next wire\\\nin the circuit with equal value, and computes the running\
            \ product polynomialz(X)as a helper polynomial\\\nto prove the product\
            \ of\\\n∏\\\nj−1\\\nk=0\\\nf(ω\\\nk\\\nX\\\n)\\\nf\\\n′\\\n(ω\\\nk\\\n\
            X\\\n)\\\n= 1\\. Similarly, we present how to indicate the position to\
            \ the next wire\\\nand how to construct the product proof through the\
            \ whole circuit.\\\nSince we need to indicate which sub-circuit the next\
            \ wire locates, we define\\\n{(\\\nσ\\\nY,s,i\\\n(X), σ\\\nX,s,i\\\n(X)\\\
            \n)}\\\ns∈{a,b,o}\\\nas: if for thei-th party, for thej-th entry in the\
            \ polynomialsis mapped to\\\nthei\\\n′\\\n-th party,j\\\n′\\\n-th entry\
            \ in the polynomials\\\n′\\\npolynomial, then\\\n(\\\nσ\\\nY,s,i\\\n(ω\\\

            \nWe have implemented the fully distributed ZKP system,Pianistand we present\
            \ the implementation details\\\nand evaluation results in this section.\\\
            \nSoftware and hardware.Our implementation is based on the Gnark \\[Gna\\\
            ] library written by Golang.\\\nOur scheme is implemented using 3700+\
            \ lines of code in Go. The bilinear map is instantiated using a\\\nBN254\
            \ curve. It provides around 100 bits of security and the pairing instruction\
            \ is supported in Solidity, the\\\nprogramming language of Ethereum smart\
            \ contracts. The experiments were executed on AWS m6i.16xlarge\\\nmachines\
            \ with 64 vCPUs and 256 GiB memory. We used the multi-threading enabled\
            \ by the Gnark library.\\\nWe opened 2–64 machines over the two regions\
            \ of California and Oregon.\\\n\\\n4.6. EXPERIMENTS92\\\nDesign of the\
            \ experiments.The goal of the experiments is to evaluate and demonstrate\
            \ the following three\\\nadvantages ofPianist:\\\n1.Linear scalability:\
            \ we measure the running time and memory usage and demonstrate thatPianisthas\\\
            \nlinear scalability in the number of machines. The running time decreases\
            \ linearly as the machine number\\\ngrows. The maximum size of the circuit\
            \ supported by the system grows linearly with the number of\\\nmachines.\\\
            \n2.Minimumcommunicationandsynchronization: we measure the communication\
            \ between the machines\\\nto demonstrate thatPianistonly incursO(1)communication\
            \ per machine inO(1)round.\\\n3.Constant proof size and verifier time:\
            \ we report the proof size and the verifier time and show that they\\\n\
            remain small in practice.\\\nThese three properties are critical for blockchain\
            \ applications where with our new system, users can con-\\\ntribute to\
            \ ZKP generations in these applications in a model similar to mining pools.\\\
            \n4.6.1 Evaluations ofPianistfor zkRollups\\\nWe first present the performance\
            \ ofPianiston data-parallel circuits in the application of zkRollups.\
            \ We use\\\nthe rollup circuit by Polygon Hermez \\[Her\\]. The circuit\
            \ is compiled using Circom \\[Cira\\] and the output format\\\nis the\
            \ rank-1-constraint-system (R1CS). AsPianistand the original Plonk do\
            \ not support R1CS directly,\\\nwe further compile the R1CS to Gnark’s\
            \ Plonk constraint. The number of R1CS constraints is about 86k\\\nper\
            \ transaction and the final Plonk circuit we use in our experiments is\
            \ about 660k per transaction. This\\\ntransformation introduces a big\
            \ overhead compared to manually designed circuits. In practice, the size\
            \ of the\\\nPlonk circuit can be reduced significantly with special gates\
            \ and lookup arguments. For example, Scroll \\[Scr\\]\\\ndesigned more\
            \ than 2000 custom gates for the zkEVM circuit. Unfortunately, we could\
            \ not find any open-\\\nsource code of the Plonk circuit for zkRollups\
            \ (even with custom gates). However, the big overhead of the\\\ntransformation\
            \ does not defeat the purpose of our experiments. No matter how many transactions\
            \ can be\\\nsupported on a single machine, we show thatPianistcan scale\
            \ it toMtimes more usingMmachines with\\\nsmall communication.\\\nProver\
            \ time.We run our distributed proof generation on 2-64 machines and Figure\
            \ 4.1 shows the result. The\\\nx-axis is the number of transactions to\
            \ batch in the zkRollups and they-axis is the prover time. We report the\\\
            \nprover time of eachP\\\ni\\\nin our scheme and the running time of the\
            \ original Plonk scheme on a single machine\\\nas a baseline. We introduced\
            \ additional optimizations to Plonk on a single machine to improve the\
            \ memory\\\nusage, and the performance shown in all of our experiments\
            \ are based on the optimized version. We run each\\\ncase to the maximum\
            \ number of transactions until the machines run out of memory. As shown\
            \ in the figure,\\\nwith 64 machines,Pianistcan prove up to 8192 transactions\
            \ in 313s, while the original Plonk can only scale\\\nto 32 transactions\
            \ with a prover time of 95s. The number of transactions and thus the maximum\
            \ circuit size\\\nscales linearly in the number of machines. Moreover,\
            \ given a fixed number of transactions, the prover time\\\nis accelerated\
            \ by the number of machines. For example, it only takes 17.5s to prove\
            \ 32 transactions using 4\\\nmachines,5.4×faster than on a single machine.\
            \ In addition, the additional time onP\\\n0\\\nto generate the final\\\
            \nproof is only 2-16ms in all of our experiments, which is extremely fast\
            \ compared to the prover time of each\\\nmachine.\\\nConstant communication,\
            \ proof size, and verifier time.In our experiments, each machine only\
            \ sends\\\n1984bytes of messages for data-parallel circuits (or2080for\
            \ general circuits) in4rounds to the master node\\\n\\\n4.6. EXPERIMENTS93\\\
            \nand receives160bytes for data-parallel (or256for general) circuits from\
            \ the master node, regardless of the\\\ntotal number of machines. Because\
            \ of this, the bandwidth and the network delay of the machines do not\
            \ affect\\\nthe results at all. This feature enables large-scale zkRollups\
            \ with the help of users globally in a model similar\\\nto a mining pool,\
            \ as the nodes do not have to stay online and deal with massive communication\
            \ with other\\\nnodes in a Map-Reduce framework as in \\[WZCPS18\\]. The\
            \ proof size is27G\\\n1\\\n(or34for general circuits)\\\nand15(or20for\
            \ general circuits)Felements (2208bytes or2816for general circuits) and\
            \ the verifier time is\\\n3.5ms in all cases regardless of the number\
            \ of transactions. Compared to the original Plonk, we use bivariate\\\n\
            polynomials, which increase the proof size by18(or25for general circuits)G\\\
            \n1\\\n,7(or12for general circuits)\\\nFelements, and the verifier time\
            \ by two pairings.\\\n4.6.2 Evaluations on General Circuits\\\nIn this\
            \ section, we further demonstrate thatPianistsupports the distributed\
            \ proof generation of general cir-\\\ncuits with arbitrary connections.\
            \ We vary the total size of the circuit from2\\\n21\\\nto2\\\n25\\\n,\
            \ and randomly sample\\\nthe type and the connection of each gate. The\
            \ circuit is evaluated and the witness is distributed evenly to\\\nmultiple\
            \ machines. In practice, the memory usage of the circuit evaluation is\
            \ not the bottleneck and the\\\nevaluation of the entire circuit can be\
            \ executed on each machine individually.\\\nProver time.In Figure 4.2,\
            \ thex-axis is the number of machines and they-axis is the prover time\
            \ of\\\neach machineP\\\ni\\\n. As shown in the Figure, the running time\
            \ is decreasing with the number of machines. In\\\nparticular, for a random\
            \ circuit of size2\\\n25\\\n, it takes 121s to generate the proof using\
            \ Plonk on a single machine\\\n(with our optimizations), while it takes\
            \ 76.9s on 2 machines inPianist,1.57×faster than Plonk. It is further\\\
            \nreduced to 5s using 32 machines, which is24.2×faster than Plonk.\\\n\
            In addition, Table 4.2 shows the additional time onP\\\n0\\\nto merge\
            \ proofs and messages fromP\\\ni\\\ns. As shown\\\nin the table, this\
            \ step only takes several milliseconds in all instances.\\\nOverhead vs.\
            \ PlonkTo show that the overhead of proving time between Pianist and Plonk,\
            \ we illustrate the\\\ncase with the same circuit size as2\\\n21\\\nper\
            \ instance in Figure 4.4. From this result, we show that the overhead\\\
            \nof Pianist is negligible.\\\nMemory usage.Figure 4.3 shows the memory\
            \ usage of the machines. As shown in the figure, inPianist,\\\nthe memory\
            \ usage on each machine decreases with the number of machines. For example,\
            \ for a circuit of size\\\n2\\\n24\\\n, it takes 70.7GB of memory to run\
            \ the original protocol on a single machine, while it only takes 31.7GB\\\
            \non each machine to runPianistusing two machines. It is further improved\
            \ to 1.92GB using 32 machines,\\\nwhich is36.8×smaller than Plonk. The\
            \ improvement is critical for zkRollups and zkEVM as the memory\\\nconsumption\
            \ of existing ZKP systems is large.Pianistis able to increase the scalability\
            \ of these schemes\\\nlinearly in the number of machines, thus batching\
            \ more transactions in one ZKP with the help of the fully\\\ndistributed\
            \ proof generations.\\\nCommunication, proof size, and verifier time.Similar\
            \ to the case of data-parallel circuits, they all remain\\\nO(1)for general\
            \ circuits. In particular, the communication is2336bytes per machine,\
            \ the proof size is2816\\\nbytes and the verifier time is 3ms.\\\n\\\n\

            Comparison with PCD and IVCAs highlighted in Section 4.1.1,Proof-Carrying\
            \ Data(PCD)\\[CT10;\\\nBCCT13\\] generates a proof at each step for newly\
            \ received transactions. To ensure the correctness of previous\\\nproofs,\
            \ there are two approaches: either aggregating a recursive proof for the\
            \ previous succinct verification\\\ncircuits in the current proof\\[BCCT13;\
            \ BSCTV14b; COS20\\], or merging each proof into an accumulator and\\\n\
            verifying them all at once \\[BCMS20; Hal; BCLMS20; KST22; KS22\\]. By\
            \ using either the aggregated veri-\\\nfication circuit or the accumulator,\
            \ the prover does not need to store the entire circuit, making these methods\\\
            \nsuitable alternatives when memory is limited.\\\nNonetheless, these\
            \ techniques share some common drawbacks. First, they all utilize recursive\
            \ proofs,\\\nwhich depend on the assumption that therandom oracle(RO)\
            \ used in the Fiat-Shamir transform can be\\\nefficiently instantiated.\
            \ Second, their proofs are generated sequentially, potentially imposing\
            \ an upper bound\\\non TPS. Third, either the succinct verification aggregation\
            \ or the accumulator demands extra effort from\\\nthe prover, which will\
            \ at least increase linearly as the number of steps grows, resulting in\
            \ reduced practical\\\nperformance. Our work, on the other hand, avoids\
            \ these issues since we do not employ recursive proofs.\\\nWe also mentionedIncremental\
            \ Verifiable Computation(IVC) for incrementally verifying stages of long-\\\
            \nrun computation, such as Nova \\[KST22\\] and SuperNova \\[KS22\\].\
            \ While Nova and SuperNova are suitable\\\nfor real-world applications\
            \ like zkRollups and zkEVM, they expose the output of each stage, which\
            \ cannot\\\nguarantee a zero-knowledge property throughout the entire\
            \ process. We argue that our work not only supports\\\ngeneral circuits,\
            \ offering a more powerful computation model but can also achieve zero-knowledge\
            \ properties\\\nusing common techniques.\\\nComparison with aPlonk \\\
            [ABST22\\]In Section 4.1.1, we mentioned an alternative solution, aPlonk,\
            \ which\\\nis based on Plonk and generalized IPA under the same settings\
            \ (distributed, shared Fiat-Shamir randomness)\\\nas our approach. However,\
            \ due to the use of IPA, their final verification cost is logarithmic\
            \ with respect to\\\nthe number of parties. Additionally, they only propose\
            \ a solution for data-parallel circuits and their solution\\\ninvolves\
            \ recursive proofs. In contrast, our proof does not require recursive\
            \ circuits, our verification cost is\\\nindependent of the number of parties,\
            \ and our approach is more flexible when generalizing to circuits with\\\
            \nconnections and general circuits. Consequently, our solution delivers\
            \ better performance, both theoretically\\\nand practically.\\\nCustom\
            \ gates.\\\nA key advantage of the Plonk scheme lies in its support for\
            \ custom gates. Users can define\\\ntheir own gate constraints, differing\
            \ from Equation 4.1, by altering term forms and introducing rotations.\\\
            \nCustom gates may increase the degree and total number of terms in Equation\
            \ 4.1, but typically reduce the\\\noverall gate count in the circuit,\
            \ leading to significant improvements in prover time in practice. As mentioned\\\
            \nearlier, Scroll \\[Scr\\] designed over 2000 custom gates to enhance\
            \ Plonk’s performance in their zkEVM im-\\\n\\\n4.7. DISCUSSIONS95\\\n\
            plementation. Our new schemes are fully compatible with custom gates by\
            \ following the outline introduced\\\nin Section 4.3.\\\nAdditionally,\
            \ as mentioned in Section 4.3, rotations can be introduced for the variableY,\
            \ and simple,\\\nregular connections among different sub-circuits can\
            \ be established based on the data-parallel setting. For\\\ninstance,\
            \ in a zkEVM context, if we treat a block of instructions as a sub-circuit,\
            \ we can define the constraint\\\nS\\\npc\\\n(X)f\\\npc\\\n(Y, X)+∆ =S\\\
            \npc\\\n(X)f\\\npc\\\n(ω\\\nY\\\nY, X)to represent the program counter\
            \ change between the previous\\\nand current blocks, whereS\\\npc\\\n\
            (X)serves as a selector to indicate the row recording the program counter.\\\
            \nLookup arguments.Lookup arguments play a crucial role in the implementation\
            \ of zkRollups and zkEVM,\\\nas they help construct proofs for RAM and\
            \ chiplet computations. Since these lookup arguments are compiled\\\n\
            into polynomial equations, we assert that they are compatible with our\
            \ system. We can identify two primary\\\nuse cases for lookup arguments:\\\
            \n1.Lookup arguments with local tables. In this scenario, each sub-circuit\
            \ possesses its own lookup\\\narguments, independent of other sub-circuits.\
            \ This setup is well-suited for situations where each ma-\\\nchine runs\
            \ a program with its local memory, for example.\\\n2.Lookup arguments\
            \ with global tables. This configuration allows applications to define\
            \ global\\\nlookup tables, such as range tables or chiplet computing.\
            \ We argue that, by leveraging the latest\\\nlookup argument research\
            \ \\[Hab22; EFG22\\] based on logarithmic derivatives, this can be easily\
            \ imple-\\\nmented. These protocols eliminate the need for cumbersome\
            \ permutations of input and table vectors,\\\nrequiring only the counting\
            \ of occurrences and the execution of a sumcheck protocol. Furthermore,\\\
            \nby employing rotation on the variableY, global tables can be distributed\
            \ across different machines,\\\nthus reducing the workload for the master\

            \ blockchains have evolved to an expansive ecosystem of various applications\
            \ and\\\ncommunities. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are gaining\
            \ rapid traction with the market cap\\\nreaching over a trillion USD \\\
            [Coi\\] and institutional investors \\[Ham22; Win21\\] taking interests.\
            \ Decentral-\\\nized Finance (DeFi) demonstrates that blockchains can\
            \ enable finance instruments that are otherwise impos-\\\nsible (e.g.,\
            \ flash loans \\[QZLG21\\]). More recently, digital artists \\[Bee\\]\
            \ and content creators \\[You\\] resort to\\\nblockchains for transparent\
            \ and accountable circulation of their works.\\\nAlso growing significantly\
            \ is the heterogeneity of the ecosystem. A wide range of blockchains have\\\
            \nbeen proposed and deployed, ranging from ones leveraging computation\
            \ (e.g., in Proof-of-Work \\[Nak08\\]),\\\nto economic incentives (e.g.,\
            \ in Proof-of-Stake \\[GHMVZ17; BLMR14; KRDO17; DGKR17; BPS16\\]), and\\\
            \nvarious other resources such as storage \\[RD16; Fil; DFKP15; ABFG14\\\
            ], and even time \\[Int\\]. While it is rather\\\nunclear that one blockchain\
            \ dominates others in all aspects, these protocols employ different techniques\
            \ and\\\nachieve different security guarantees and performance. It has\
            \ thus been envisioned that (e.g., in \\[Amu; Mul;\\\nBut\\]) the ecosystem\
            \ will grow to amulti-chainfuture where various protocols co-exist, and\
            \ developers and\\\nusers can choose the best blockchain based on their\
            \ preferences, the cost, and the offered amenities.\\\nA central challenge\
            \ in the multi-chain universe is how to enable securecross-chain bridgesthrough\\\
            \nwhich applications on different blockchains can communicate. An ecosystem\
            \ with efficient and inexpensive\\\nbridges will enable assets held on\
            \ one chain to effortlessly participate in marketplaces hosted on other\
            \ chains.\\\nIn effect, an efficient system of bridges will do for blockchains\
            \ what the Internet did for siloed communication\\\nnetworks.\\\nThe core\
            \ functionality of a bridge between blockchainsC\\\n1\\\nandC\\\n2\\\n\
            is to prove to applications onC\\\n2\\\nthat\\\na certain event took place\
            \ onC\\\n1\\\n, and vice versa. We use a generic notion of a bridge, namely\
            \ one that can\\\nperform multiple functions: message passing, asset transfers,\
            \ etc. In our modular design, the bridge itself\\\nneither involves nor\
            \ is restricted to any application-specific logic.\\\nTheproblem.While\
            \ cross-chain bridges have been built in practice \\[Rai; Polb; Lay; Axe\\\
            ], existing solutions\\\neither suffer from poor performance, or rely\
            \ on central parties.\\\nThe operation of the bridge depends on the consensus\
            \ protocols of both chains. IfC\\\n1\\\nruns Proof-of-\\\nWork, a natural\
            \ idea is to use a light client protocol (e.g., SPV \\[Nak08\\]). Specifically,\
            \ a smart contract on\\\nC\\\n2\\\n, denoted bySC\\\n2\\\n, will keep\
            \ track of block headers ofC\\\n1\\\n, based on which transaction inclusion\
            \ (and other\\\nevents) can be verified with Merkle proofs. This approach,\
            \ however, incurs a significant computation and\\\nstorage overhead, sinceSC\\\
            \n2\\\nneeds to verify all block headers and keep a long and ever-growing\
            \ list of them.\\\nFor non-PoW chains, the verification can be even more\
            \ expensive. For example, for a bridge between a Proof-\\\nof-Stake chain\
            \ (like Cosmos) and Ethereum, verifying a single block header on Ethereum\
            \ would cost about\\\n64 million gas \\[Nea\\] (about $6300 at time of\
            \ writing), which is prohibitively high.\\\nCurrently, as an efficient\
            \ alternative, many bridge protocols (PolyNetwork, Wormhole, Ronin, etc.)\
            \ resort\\\nto a committee-based approach: a committee of validators are\
            \ entrusted to sign off on state transfers. In these\\\nsystems, the security\
            \ boils down to, e.g., the honest majority assumption. This is problematic\
            \ for two reasons.\\\nFirst, the extra trust assumption in the committee\
            \ means the bridged asset is not as secure as native ones,\\\ncomplicating\
            \ the security analysis of downstream applications. Second, relying on\
            \ a small committee can\\\nlead to single point failures. Indeed, in a\
            \ recent exploit of the Ronin bridge \\[Ron\\], the attackers were able\
            \ to\\\nobtain five of the nine validator keys, through which they stole\
            \ 624 million USD, making it the largest attack\\\nin the history of DeFi\
            \ by Apr 2022¹. Even the second and third largest attacks are also against\
            \ bridges ($611m\\\n¹see the ranking athttps://rekt.news/leaderboard\\\
            \n104\\\n\\\nwas stolen from PolyNetwork \\[Pola\\] and $326m was stolen\
            \ from Wormhole \\[Wora\\]), and key compromise\\\nwas suspected in the\
            \ PolyNetwork attack.\\\nOur approach.We presentzkBridgeto enable an efficient\
            \ cross-chain bridge without trusting a centralized\\\ncommittee. The\
            \ main idea is to leverage zk-SNARK, which are succinct non-interactive\
            \ proofs (arguments) of\\\nknowledge \\[WTSTW18; XZZPS19b; Zha+21a; BSBHR19;\
            \ BSCTV14c; AHIV17; BSCRSVW19; COS20;\\\nCHMMVW20; ZGKPP17d; ZGKPP18;\
            \ BBBPWM18; GWC19b; Set20\\]. A zk-SNARK enables a prover to\\\nefficiently\
            \ convinceSC\\\n2\\\nthat a certain state transition took place onC\\\n\
            1\\\n. To do so,SC\\\n2\\\nwill keep track of\\\na digestDof the latest\
            \ tip ofC\\\n1\\\n. To syncSC\\\n2\\\nwith new blocks inC\\\n1\\\n, anyone\
            \ can generate and submit a\\\nzk-SNARK that proves toSC\\\n2\\\nthat\
            \ the tip ofC\\\n1\\\nhas advanced fromDtoD\\\n′\\\n.\\\nThis design offers\
            \ three benefits. First, the soundness property of a zk-SNARK ensures\
            \ the security of\\\nthe bridge. Thus, we do not need additional security\
            \ requirements beyond the security of the underlying\\\nblockchains. In\
            \ particularzkBridgedoes not rely on a committee for security. Second,\
            \ with a purpose-built\\\nzk-SNARK,C\\\n2\\\ncan verify a state transition\
            \ ofC\\\n1\\\nfar more efficiently than encoding the consensus logic ofC\\\
            \n1\\\ninSC\\\n2\\\n. In this way, as an example forzkBridgefrom Cosmos\
            \ to Ethereum, we reduce the proof verification\\\ncost from∼80Mgas to\
            \ less than230Kgas onC\\\n2\\\n. The storage overhead of the bridge is\
            \ reduced to constant.\\\nThird, by separating the bridge from application-specific\
            \ logic,zkBridgemakes it easy to enable additional\\\napplications on\
            \ top of the bridge.\\\nTechnical challenges.To prove correctness of a\
            \ given computation outcome using a zk-SNARK, one first\\\nneeds to express\
            \ the computation as an arithmetic circuit. While zk-SNARK verification\
            \ is fast (logarithmic\\\nin the size of the circuit or even constant),\
            \ proof generation time is at least linear, and in practice can be\\\n\
            prohibitively expensive. Moreover, components used by real-world blockchains\
            \ are not easily expressed as\\\nan arithmetic circuit. For example, the\
            \ widely used EdDSA digital signature scheme is very efficient to verify\\\
            \non a CPU, but is expensive to express as an arithmetic circuit, requiring\
            \ more than 2 million gates \\[Cirb\\]. In\\\na cross-chain bridge, each\
            \ state transition could require the verification of hundreds of signatures\
            \ depending\\\non the chains, making it prohibitively expensive to generate\
            \ the required zk-SNARK proof. In order to make\\\nzkBridgepractical,\
            \ we must reduce proof generation time.\\\nTo this end, we propose two\
            \ novel ideas. First, we observe that the circuits used by cross-chain\
            \ bridges\\\naredata-parallel, in that they contain multiple identical\
            \ copies of a smaller sub-circuit. Specifically, the\\\ncircuit for verifyingNdigital\
            \ signatures containsNcopies of the signature verification sub-circuit.\
            \ To\\\nleverage the data-parallelism, we proposedeVirgo, a novel distributed\
            \ zero-knowledge proofs protocol based\\\non Virgo \\[ZXZS20\\].deVirgoenjoys\
            \ perfect linear scalability, namely, the proof generation time can be\\\
            \nreduced by a factor ofMif the generation is distributed overMmachines.\
            \ The protocol is of independent\\\ninterest and might be useful in other\
            \ scenarios. Other proof systems can be similarly parallelized \\[WZCPS18\\\
            ].\\\nWhiledeVirgosignificantly reduces the proof generation time, verifyingdeVirgoproofs\
            \ on chain, es-\\\npecially for the billion-gate circuits inzkBridge,\
            \ can be expensive for smart contracts where computational\\\nresources\
            \ are extremely limited. To compress the proof size and the verification\
            \ cost, we recursively prove the\\\ncorrectness of a (potentially large)deVirgoproof\
            \ using a classic zk-SNARK due to Groth \\[Gro16\\], hereafter\\\ndenoted\
            \ Groth16. The Groth16 prover outputs constant-size proofs that are fast\
            \ to verify by a smart contract\\\non an EVM blockchain. We stress that\
            \ one cannot use Groth16 to generate the entirezkBridgeproof because\\\
            \nthe circuits needed inzkBridgeare too large for a Groth16 prover. Instead,\
            \ our approach of compressing\\\nadeVirgoproof using Groth16 gives the\
            \ best of both worlds: a fastdeVirgoparallel prover for the bulk of\\\n\
            the proof, where the resulting proof is compressed into a succinct Groth16\
            \ proof that is fast to verify. We\\\nelaborate on this technique in Section\
            \ 5.5. This approach to compressing long proofs is also being adopted\\\

            \ a trustless, efficient, and secure cross-chain bridge whose security\\\
            \nrelies on succinct proofs (cryptographic assumptions) rather than a\
            \ committee (external trust assumptions).\\\nCompared with existing cross-chain\
            \ bridge projects in the wild,zkBridgeis the first solution that achieves\\\
            \nthe following properties at the same time.\\\n–Trustless and Secure:\\\
            \nThe correctness of block headers on remote blockchains is proven by\
            \ zk-\\\nSNARKs, and thus no external trust assumptions are introduced.\
            \ Indeed, as long as the connected\\\nblockchains and the underlying light-client\
            \ protocols are secure, and there exists at least one honest\\\nnode in\
            \ the block header relay network,zkBridgeis secure.\\\n–Permissionless\
            \ and Decentralized:Any node can freely join the network to relay block\
            \ headers,\\\ngenerate proofs, and claim the rewards. Due to the elimination\
            \ of the commonly-used central or\\\nProof-of-Stake style committee for\
            \ block header validation,zkBridgealso enjoys better decentraliza-\\\n\
            tion.\\\n–Extensible:Smart contracts usingzkBridgeenjoy maximum flexibility\
            \ because they can invoke the\\\nupdater contract to retrieve verified\
            \ block headers, and then perform their application-specific verifi-\\\
            \ncation and functionality (e.g., verifying transaction inclusion through\
            \ auxiliary Merkle proofs). By\\\nseparating the bridge from application-specific\
            \ logic,zkBridgemakes it easy to develop applications\\\non top of the\
            \ bridge.\\\n–Universal:The block header relay network and the underlying\
            \ proof scheme inzkBridgeis universal\\\n–Eﬀicient:With our highly optimized\
            \ recursive proof scheme, block headers can be relayed within a\\\nshort\
            \ time (usually tens of seconds for proof generation), and the relayed\
            \ information can be quickly\\\nfinalized as soon as the proof is verified,\
            \ thus supporting fast and flexible bridging of information.\\\nIn summary,\
            \ zkBridge is a huge leap towards building a secure, trustless foundation\
            \ for blockchain inter-\\\noperability.\\\n•We propose a novel 2-layer\
            \ recursive proof system, which is of independent interest, as the underlying\
            \ zk-\\\nSNARK protocol to achieve both reasonable proof generation time\
            \ and on-chain verification cost. Through\\\nthe coordination ofdeVirgoand\
            \ Groth16, we achieve a desirable balance between efficiency and cost.\\\
            \n106\\\n\\\n–For the first layer, aiming at prompt proof generation,\
            \ we introducedeVirgo, a distributed version\\\nof Virgo proof system.deVirgocombines\
            \ distributed sumcheck and distributed polynomial com-\\\nmitment to achieve\
            \ optimal parallelism, through which the proof generation phase is much\
            \ more\\\naccelerated by running on distributed machines.deVirgois more\
            \ than 100x faster than Virgo for the\\\nworkload inzkBridge.\\\n–For\
            \ the second layer, aiming at acceptable on-chain verification cost, we\
            \ use Groth16 to recursively\\\nprove that the previously generated proof\
            \ bydeVirgoindeed proves the validity of the corresponding\\\nremote block\
            \ headers. Through the second layer, the verification gas cost is reduced\
            \ from an\\\nestimated∼80Mto less than230K, making on-chain verification\
            \ practical.\\\n•We implement an end-to-end prototype ofzkBridgeand evaluate\
            \ its performance in two scenarios: from\\\nCosmos to Ethereum (which\
            \ is the main focus since it involves large proof circuits that existing\
            \ systems\\\ncannot efficiently handle), and from Ethereum to other EVM-compatible\
            \ chains (which in comparison in-\\\nvolves much smaller circuits). The\
            \ experiment results show thatzkBridgeachieves practical performance\\\
            \nand is the first practical cross-chain bridge that achieves cryptographic\
            \ assurance of correctness.\\\n5.2 Background\\\nIn this section we cover\
            \ the preliminaries, essential background on blockchains, and zero-knowledge\
            \ proofs.\\\n5.2.1 Notations\\\nLetFbe a finite field andλbe a security\
            \ parameter. We usef(), h()for polynomials,x, yfor single variables,\\\
            \nbold lettersx,yfor vectors of variables. Bothx\\[i\\]andx\\\ni\\\ndenote\
            \ thei-th element inx. Forx, we use notation\\\nx\\[i:k\\]to denote slices\
            \ of vectorx, namelyx\\[i:k\\] = (x\\\ni\\\n, x\\\ni+1\\\n,···, x\\\n\
            k\\\n). We useito denote the vector of\\\nthe binary representation of\
            \ some integeri.\\\nMerkle Tree.Merkle tree \\[Mer87\\] is a data structure\
            \ widely used to build commitments to vectors because\\\nof its simplicity\
            \ and efficiency. The prover time is linear in the size of the vector\
            \ while the verifier time and\\\nproof size are logarithmic in the size\
            \ of the vector. Given a vector ofx= (x\\\n0\\\n,···, x\\\nN−1\\\n), it\
            \ consists of\\\nthree algorithms:\\\n•rt←MT.Commit(x)\\\n•(x\\[i\\],\
            \ π\\\ni\\\n)←MT.Open(x, i)\\\n•{1,0}←MT.Verify(π\\\ni\\\n,x\\[i\\],rt).\\\
            \n5.2.2 Blockchains\\\nA blockchain is a distributed protocol where a\
            \ group of nodes collectively maintains aledgerwhich consists\\\nof an\
            \ ordered list ofblocks. A blockblkis a data-structure that stores a headerblkHand\
            \ a list of transactions,\\\ndenoted byblk={blkH;trx\\\n1\\\n, . . . ,trx\\\
            \nt\\\n}. A block header contains metadata about the block, including\
            \ a\\\npointer to the previous block, a compact representation of the\
            \ transactions (typically a Merkle tree root),\\\n107\\\n\\\nvalidity\
            \ proofs such as solutions to cryptopuzzles in Proof-of-Work systems or\
            \ validator signatures in Proof-\\\nof-Stake ones.\\\nSecurity of blockchains.The\
            \ security of blockchains has been studied extensively. Suppose the ledger\
            \ in\\\nparty\\\ni\\\n’s local view is\\\nLOG\\\nr\\\ni\\\n= \\[\\\nblk\\\
            \n1\\\n,\\\nblk\\\n2\\\n, . . . ,\\\nblk\\\nr\\\n\\]\\\nwhere\\\nr\\\n\
            is the\\\nheight\\\n. For any\\\n2\\\n≤\\\nk\\\n≤\\\nr\\\nand the\\\n\
            k\\\n-th\\\nblockblk\\\nk\\\n,blk\\\nk\\\n.ptr=blkH\\\nk−1\\\n, so every\
            \ single block is linked to the previous one. For the purpose of this\\\
            \npaper, we care about two (informal) properties:\\\n1.Consistency: For\
            \ any honest nodesiandj, and for any rounds ofr\\\n0\\\nandr\\\n1\\\n\
            , it must be satisfied that\\\neitherLOG\\\nr\\\n0\\\ni\\\nis a prefix\
            \ ofLOG\\\nr\\\n1\\\nj\\\nor vice versa.\\\n2.Liveness: If an honest node\
            \ receives some transactiontrxat some roundr, thentrxwill be included\\\
            \ninto the blockchain of all honest nodes eventually.\\\nSmartcontractsandgas.In\
            \ addition to reaching consensus over the content of the ledger, many\
            \ blockchains\\\nsupport expressive user-defined programs calledsmart\
            \ contracts, which are stateful programs with state\\\npersisted on a\
            \ blockchain. Without loss of generality, smart contract states can be\
            \ viewed a key-value store\\\n(and often implemented as such.) Users send\
            \ transactions to interact with a smart contract, and potentially\\\n\
            alter its state.\\\nA key limitation of existing smart contract platforms\
            \ is that computation and storage are scarce resources\\\nand can be considerably\
            \ expensive. Typically smart contract platforms such as Ethereum charge\
            \ a fee (some-\\\ntimes called gas) for every step of computation. For\
            \ instance, EdDSA signatures are extremely cheap to\\\nverify (a performant\
            \ CPU can verify 71000 of them in a second \\[BDLSY12\\]), but verifying\
            \ a single EdDSA\\\nsignature on Ethereum costs about 500K gas, which\
            \ is about $49 at the time of writing. Storage is also ex-\\\npensive\
            \ on Ethereum. Storing 1KB of data costs about 0.032 ETH, which can be\
            \ converted to approximately\\\n$90 at the time of writing. This limitation\
            \ is not unique to Ethereum but rather a reflection of the low capacity\\\
            \nof permissionless blockchains in general. Therefore reducing on-chain\
            \ computation and storage overhead is\\\none of the key goals.\\\n5.2.3\
            \ Light client protocol\\\nIn a blockchain network, there are full nodes\
            \ as well as light ones. Full nodes store the entire history of the\\\n\
            blockchain and verify all transactions in addition to verifying block\
            \ headers. Light clients, on the other hand,\\\nonly store the headers,\
            \ and therefore can only verify a subset of correctness properties.\\\n\
            The workings of light clients depend on the underlying consensus protocol.\
            \ The original Bitcoin paper\\\ncontains a light client protocol (SPV\
            \ \\[Nak08\\]) that uses Merkle proofs to enable a light client who only\
            \ stores\\\nrecent headers to verify transaction inclusion. A number of\
            \ improvements have been proposed ever since. For\\\ninstance, in Proof-of-Stake,\
            \ typically a light client needs to verify account balances in the whole\
            \ blockchain\\\nhistory (or up to a snapshot), and considers the risk\
            \ of long range attacks. For BFT-based consensus, a light\\\nclient needs\
            \ to verify validator signatures and keeps track of validator rotation.\
            \ We refer readers to \\[CBC21\\]\\\nfor a survey.\\\nTo abstract consensus-specific\
            \ details away, we use\\\nLightCC(LCS\\\nr−1\\\n,blkH\\\nr−1\\\n,blkH\\\
            \nr\\\n)→{true,false}\\\n108\\\n\\\nto denote the block validation rule\
            \ of a light client: given a new block headerblkH\\\nr\\\n,LightCCdetermines\
            \ if\\\nthe header represents a valid next block afterblkH\\\nr−1\\\n\
            given its current stateLCS\\\nr−1\\\n. We define the required\\\nproperties\
            \ of a light client protocol as follows:\\\nDefinition 5.2.1(Light client\
            \ protocol).A light client protocol enables a node to synchronize the\
            \ block\\\nheaders of the state of the blockchain. Suppose all block headers\
            \ in partyi’s local view isLOGH\\\nr\\\ni\\\n=\\\n\\[blkH\\\n1\\\n,blkH\\\
            \n2\\\n, ...,blkH\\\nr\\\n\\], the light client protocol satisfies following\
            \ properties:\\\n1.Succinctness: For each state update, the light client\
            \ protocol only takesO(1)time to synchronize the\\\nstate.\\\n2.Liveness:\
            \ If an honest full node receives some transactiontrxat some roundr, thentrxmust\
            \ be\\\nincluded into the blockchain eventually. A light client protocol\
            \ will eventually include a block header\\\nblkH\\\ni\\\nsuch that the\
            \ corresponding block includes the transactiontrx.\\\n3.Consistency: For\
            \ any honest nodesiandj, and for any rounds ofr\\\n0\\\nandr\\\n1\\\n\
            , it must be satisfied that\\\neitherLOGH\\\nr\\\n0\\\ni\\\nis a prefix\

            \nprotocol in more detail. For ease of exposition, we focus on one direction\
            \ of the bridge, but the operation of\\\nthe opposite direction is symmetric.\\\

            \ For clarity we only show one direction of the bridge and the\\\nopposite\
            \ direction is symmetric.\\\n5.3.1 Overview ofzkBridgedesign\\\nTo make\
            \ it easy for different applications to integrate withzkBridge, we adopt\
            \ a modular design where we\\\nseparate application-specific logic (e.g.,\
            \ verifying smart contract states) from the core bridge functionality\\\
            \n(i.e., relaying block headers).\\\nFigure 5.1 shows the architecture\
            \ and workflow ofzkBridge. The core bridge functionality is provided\\\
            \nby ablock header relay network(trusted only for liveness) that relays\
            \ block headers ofC\\\n1\\\nalong with\\\ncorrectness proofs, and anupdater\
            \ contractonC\\\n2\\\nthat verifies and accepts proofs submitted by relay\
            \ nodes.\\\nThe updater contract maintains a list of recent block headers,\
            \ and updates it properly after verifying proofs\\\nsubmitted by relay\
            \ nodes; it exposes a simple and application-agnostic API, from which\
            \ application smart\\\n²In our construction, we only need a succinct non-interactive\
            \ arguments of knowledge (SNARK) satisfying the first\\\ntwo properties\
            \ and the succinctnes for validity. The zero knowledge property could\
            \ be used to further achieve privacy.\\\n110\\\n\\\ncontracts can obtain\
            \ the latest block headers of the sender blockchain and build application-specific\
            \ logic on\\\ntop of it.\\\nApplications relying onzkBridgewill typically\
            \ deploy a pair of contracts, a sender contract and a receiver\\\ncontract\
            \ onC\\\n1\\\nandC\\\n2\\\n, respectively. We refer to them collectively\
            \ as application contracts or relying contracts.\\\nThe receiver contract\
            \ can call the updater contract to obtain block headers ofC\\\n1\\\n,\
            \ based on which they can\\\nperform application specific tasks. Depending\
            \ on the application, receiver contracts might also need a user\\\nor\
            \ a third party to provide application-specific proofs, such as Merkle\
            \ proofs for smart contract states.\\\nAs an example, Fig. 5.1 shows the\
            \ workflow ofcross-chain token transfer, a common use case of bridges,\\\
            \nfacilitated byzkBridge. Suppose a userUwants to trade assets (tokens)\
            \ she owns on blockchainC\\\n1\\\nin an\\\nexchange residing on another\
            \ blockchainC\\\n2\\\n(presumably becauseC\\\n2\\\ncharges lower fees\
            \ or has better liquidity),\\\nshe needs to move her funds fromC\\\n1\\\
            \ntoC\\\n2\\\n. A pair of smart contractsSC\\\nlock\\\nandSC\\\nmint\\\
            \nare deployed on\\\nblockchainsC\\\n1\\\nandC\\\n2\\\nrespectively. To\
            \ move the funds, the user locks$vtokens inSC\\\nlock\\\n(step ① in Fig.\
            \ 5.1)\\\nand then requests$vtokens to be issued bySC\\\nmint\\\n. To\
            \ ensure solvency,SC\\\nmint\\\nshould only issue new tokens\\\nif and\
            \ only if the user has locked tokens onC\\\n1\\\n. This requiresSC\\\n\
            mint\\\nto read the states ofSC\\\nlock\\\n(the balance\\\nofU, updated\
            \ in step ② ) from a different blockchain, which it cannot do directly.zkBridgeenables\
            \ this\\\nby relaying the block headers ofC\\\n1\\\ntoC\\\n2\\\nalong\
            \ with proofs (step ③ and ④ ).SC\\\nmint\\\ncan retrieve the block\\\n\
            headers from the smart contract frontend (the updater contract), check\
            \ that the balance of userUis indeed\\\n$v(step ⑤ ), and only then mint$vtokens\
            \ (Step ⑥ ).\\\nBesides cross-chain token transfer,zkBridgecan also enable\
            \ various other applications such as cross-\\\nchain collateralized loans,\
            \ general message passing, etc. We present three use cases in Section\
            \ 5.3.3.\\\n5.3.2 Protocol detail\\\nHaving presented the overview, in\
            \ this section, we specify the protocol in more detail.\\\nSecurity and\
            \ system model\\\nFor the purpose of modeling bridges, we model a blockchainCas\
            \ a block-number-indexed key-value\\\nstore, denoted asC\\[t\\] :K →Vwheretis\
            \ the block number,KandVare key and value spaces respectively.\\\nIn Ethereum,\
            \ for example,V={0,1}\\\n256\\\nand keys are the concatenation of a smart\
            \ contract identifierSC\\\nand a per-smart-contract storage addressK.\
            \ For a given contractSC, we denote the value stored at address\\\nKat\
            \ block numbertasSC\\[t, K\\], and we callSC\\[t,·\\]thestateofSCat block\
            \ numbert. Again, for ease of\\\nexposition, we focus on the direction\
            \ fromSC\\\n1\\\ntoSC\\\n2\\\n, denoted asBR\\[SC\\\n1\\\n→SC\\\n2\\\n\
            \\].\\\nFunctional and security goals.We require the bridgeBR\\[SC\\\n\
            1\\\n→ SC\\\n2\\\n\\]to reflect states ofSC\\\n1\\\ncorrectly\\\nand timely:\\\
            \n1.Correctness: For allt, K,SC\\\n2\\\naccepts a wrong stateV̸=SC\\\n\
            1\\\n\\[t, K\\]with negligible probability.\\\n2.Liveness: SupposeSC\\\
            \n2\\\nneeds to verifySC\\\n1\\\n’s state at(t, K), the bridge will provide\
            \ necessary informa-\\\ntion eventually.\\\nSecurity assumptions.For correctness,zkBridgedoes\
            \ not introduce extra trust assumptions besides those\\\nmade by the underlying\
            \ blockchains. Namely, we assume both the sender blockchain and the receiver\\\
            \nblockchain are consistent and live (Section 5.2), and the sender chain\
            \ has a light client protocol to enable\\\nfast block header verification.\
            \ For both properties, we assume there is at least one honest node in\
            \ the relay\\\nnetwork, and that the zk-SNARK used is sound.\\\n111\\\n\
            \\\nConstruction ofzkBridge\\\nAs described in Section 5.3, a bridgeBR\\\
            [SC\\\n1\\\n→ SC\\\n2\\\n\\]consists of three components: a block header\\\
            \nrelay network, a updater contract, and one or more application contracts.\
            \ Below we specify the protocols for\\\neach component.\\\nBlock header\
            \ relay network.We present the formal protocol of block header relay network\
            \ in Protocol 14.\\\nProtocol 14Block header relay network\\\nprocedureRELAYNEXTHEADER(LCS\\\
            \nr−1\\\n,blkH\\\nr−1\\\n)\\\nContactkdifferent full nodes to get the\
            \ block headers followingblkH\\\nr−1\\\n, namelyblkH\\\nr\\\n.\\\nGenerate\
            \ a ZKPπproving\\\nLightCC(LCS\\\nr−1\\\n,blkH\\\nr−1\\\n,blkH\\\nr\\\n\
            )→true.\\\nSend(π,blkH\\\nr\\\n,blkH\\\nr−1\\\n)to the updater contract.\\\
            \nNodes in the block header relay network runRelayNextHeaderwith the current\
            \ state of the updater\\\ncontract (LCS\\\nr−1\\\n,blkH\\\nr−1\\\n) as\
            \ input. The exact definition ofLCS\\\nr−1\\\nis specific to light client\
            \ protocols\\\n(see \\[CBC21\\] for a survey). The relay node then connects\
            \ to full nodes inC\\\n1\\\nand gets the block headerblkH\\\nr\\\nfollowingblkH\\\
            \nr−1\\\n. The relay node generates a ZKPπshowing the correctness ofblkH\\\
            \nr\\\n, by essentially\\\nproving thatblkH\\\nr\\\nis accepted by a light\
            \ client ofC\\\n1\\\nafter blockblkH\\\nr−1\\\n. It then sends(π,blkH\\\
            \nr\\\n)to the\\\nupdater contract onC\\\n2\\\n. To avoid the wasted proof\
            \ time due to collision (note that when multiple relay nodes\\\nsend at\
            \ the same time, only one proof can be accepted), relay nodes can coordinate\
            \ using standard techniques\\\n(e.g., to send in a round robin fashion).\
            \ While any zero-knowledge proofs protocol could be used, our highly\\\
            \noptimized one will be presented later in Section 5.4.\\\nTo incentivize\
            \ block header relay nodes, provers may be rewarded with fees after validating\
            \ their proofs.\\\nWe leave incentive design for future work. A prerequisite\
            \ of any incentive scheme is unstealability \\[SCPTZ21\\],\\\ni.e., the\
            \ guarantee that malicious nodes cannot steal others’ proofs. To this\
            \ end, provers will embed their iden-\\\ntifiers (public keys) in proofs,\
            \ e.g., as input to the hash function in the Fiat-Shamir heuristic \\\
            [FS86\\].\\\nWe note that this design relies on the security of the light\
            \ client verifier of the sender chain. For example,\\\nthe light client\
            \ verifier must reject a valid block header that may eventually become\
            \ orphaned and not part of\\\nthe sender chain.\\\nThe updater contract.The\
            \ protocol for the updater contract is specified in Protocol 15.\\\nThe\
            \ updater contract maintains the light client’s internal state including\
            \ a list of block headers ofC\\\n1\\\ninheaderDAG. It has two publicly\
            \ exposed functions. TheHeaderUpdatefunction can be invoked by any\\\n\
            block header relay node, providing supposedly the next block header and\
            \ a proof as input. If the proof verifies\\\nagainst the current light\
            \ client stateLCSandblkH\\\nr−1\\\n, the contract will do further light-client\
            \ checks, and\\\nthen the state will be updated accordingly. Since the\
            \ caller of this function must pay a fee, DoS attacks are\\\nnaturally\
            \ prevented.\\\nTheGetHeaderfunction can be called by receiver contracts\
            \ to get the block header at heightt. Receiver\\\ncontracts can use the\
            \ obtained block header to finish application-specific verification, potentially\
            \ with the\\\nhelp of a user or some third party.\\\nApplication contracts.zkBridgehas\
            \ a modular design in that the updater contract is application-agnostic.\\\
            \nTherefore inBR\\[SC\\\n1\\\n→SC\\\n2\\\n\\], it is up to the application\
            \ contractsSC\\\n1\\\nandSC\\\n2\\\nto decide what the informa-\\\n112\\\

            \ are\\\ntypically provided by the users ofSC\\\n2\\\n, some third party,\
            \ or the developer/maintainer ofSC\\\n2\\\n.\\\nSecurity arguments.The\
            \ security ofzkBridgeis stated in the following theorem.\\\nTheorem 5.3.1.The\
            \ bridgeBR\\[SC\\\n1\\\n→SC\\\n2\\\n\\]implemented by protocols 14 and\
            \ 15 satisfies both consistency\\\nand liveness, assuming the following\
            \ holds:\\\n1.there is at least one honest node in the block header relay\
            \ network;\\\n2.the sender chain is consistent and live;\\\n3.the sender\
            \ chain has a light-client verifier as in Def. 5.2.1; and\\\n4.the succinct\
            \ proof system is sound.\\\nProof (sketch).To prove the consistency of\
            \ DAG, we first need to convert the DAG into a list of blocks to\\\nmatch\
            \ the definition of blockchain consistency. We define an algorithmLongest:DAG→Listsuch\
            \ that\\\ngiven a DAG, the algorithm will output a listMainChainrepresenting\
            \ the main chain. For example, if the\\\nsender chain is Ethereum, the\
            \ algorithmLongestwill first calculate the path with the maximum total\
            \ difficulty\\\nin the DAG represented byL, and then outputMainChain:=L\\\
            [:−K\\]. HereKis a security parameter. By\\\nassumption1and2, there will\
            \ be an honest node in our system running either a full node or a light\
            \ node,\\\nwhich will be consistent with the sender chain. Also, according\
            \ to assumption1, at least one prover node\\\nis honestly proving the\
            \ light client execution. By assumption4that the proof system is sound,\
            \ the updater\\\ncontract will correctly verify the light-client state.\
            \ We argue that the updater contract is correctly running the\\\nlight-client\
            \ protocol. Therefore, by the consistency of the light-client protocol,MainChainwill\
            \ be consistent\\\nwith any other honest node.\\\n113\\\n\\\nThe liveness\
            \ of our protocol directly follows from the liveness ofC\\\n1\\\nand its\
            \ light client protocol.\\\n5.3.3 Application use cases\\\nIn this section,\
            \ we present three examples of applications thatzkBridgecan support.\\\
            \nTransaction inclusion: a building block.A common building block of cross-chain\
            \ applications is to verify\\\ntransaction inclusion on another blockchain.\
            \ Specifically, the goal is to enable a receiver contractSC\\\n2\\\nonC\\\
            \n2\\\nto verify that a given transactiontrxhas been included in a blockB\\\
            \nt\\\nonC\\\n1\\\nat heightt. To do so, the receiver\\\ncontractSC\\\n\
            2\\\nneeds a user or a third-party service to provide the Merkle proof\
            \ fortrxinB\\\nt\\\n. Then,SC\\\n2\\\nwill\\\ncall the updater contract\
            \ to retrieve the block header ofC\\\n1\\\nat heightt, and then verify\
            \ the provided Merkle\\\nproof against the Merkle root contained in the\
            \ header.\\\nNext, we will present three use cases that extend the building\
            \ block above.\\\n1\\. Message passing and data sharing.Cross-chain message\
            \ passing is another common building block\\\nuseful for, e.g., sharing\
            \ off-chain data cross blockchains.\\\nMessage passing can be realized\
            \ as a simple extension of transaction inclusion, by embedding the mes-\\\
            \nsage in a transaction. Specifically, to pass a messagemfromC\\\n1\\\n\
            toC\\\n2\\\n, a user can embedmin a transaction\\\ntrx\\\nm\\\n, sendtrx\\\
            \nm\\\ntoC\\\n1\\\n, and then execute the above transaction inclusion\
            \ proof.\\\n2\\. Cross-chain assets transfer/swap.Bridging native assets\
            \ is a common use case with growing demand.\\\nIn this application, users\
            \ can stake a certain amount of tokenT\\\nA\\\non the sender blockchainC\\\
            \n1\\\n, and get the same\\\namount of tokenT\\\nA\\\n(for native assets\
            \ transfer if eligible) or a certain amount of tokenT\\\nB\\\nof approximately\
            \ the\\\nsame value (for native assets swap) on the receiver blockchainC\\\
            \n2\\\n. With the help of the transaction inclusion\\\nproof, native assets\
            \ transfer/swap can be achieved, as illustrated at a high level in Section\
            \ 5.3.1. Here we\\\nspecify the protocol in more detail.\\\nTo set up,\
            \ the developers will deploy a lock contractSC\\\nlock\\\nonC\\\n1\\\n\
            and a mint contractSC\\\nmint\\\nonC\\\n2\\\n. For\\\na user who wants\
            \ to exchangen\\\nA\\\nof tokenT\\\nA\\\nfor an equal value in tokenT\\\
            \nB\\\n, she will first send a transaction\\\ntrx\\\nlock\\\nthat transfersn\\\
            \nA\\\nof tokenT\\\nA\\\ntoSC\\\nlock\\\n, along with an addressaddr\\\
            \nC\\\n2\\\nto receive tokenT\\\nB\\\nonC\\\n2\\\n.\\\nAftertrx\\\nlock\\\
            \nis confirmed in a blockB, the user will send a transactiontrx\\\nmint\\\
            \ntoSC\\\nmint\\\n, including sufficient\\\ninformation to verify the\
            \ inclusion oftrx\\\nlock\\\n. Based on information intrx\\\nmint\\\n\
            ,SC\\\nmint\\\nwill verify thattrx\\\nlock\\\nhas been included onC\\\n\
            1\\\n, and transfer the correspondingT\\\nB\\\ntokens to the addressaddr\\\
            \nC\\\n2\\\nspecified intrx\\\nlock\\\n.\\\nFinally,SC\\\nmint\\\nwill\
            \ marktrx\\\nlock\\\nas minted to conclude the transfer.\\\n3\\. Interoperations\
            \ for NFTs.In the application of Non-fungible Token (NFT) interoperations,\
            \ users al-\\\nways lock/stake the NFT on the sender blockchain, and get\
            \ minted NFT or NFT derivatives on the receiver\\\nblockchain. By designing\
            \ the NFT derivatives, the cross-chain protocol can separate the ownership\
            \ and util-\\\nity of an NFT on two blockchain systems, thus supporting\
            \ locking the ownership of the NFT on the sender\\\nblockchain and getting\
            \ the utility on the receiver blockchain.\\\n5.3.4 Eﬀicient Proof Systems\
            \ forzkBridge\\\nThe most computationally demanding part ofzkBridgeis\
            \ the zero-knowledge proofs generation that relay\\\nnodes must do for\
            \ every block. So far we have abstracted away the detail of proof generation,\
            \ which we will\\\naddress in Sections 5.4 and 5.5. Here, we present an\
            \ overview of our solution.\\\nFor Proof-of-Stake chains, the proofs involve\
            \ verifying hundreds of signatures. A major source of over-\\\nhead is\
            \ field transformation between different elliptic curves when the sender\
            \ and receiver chains use different\\\n114\\\n\\\ncryptography implementation,\
            \ which is quite common in practice. For example, Cosmos uses EdDSA on\\\
            \nCurve25519 whereas Ethereum natively supports a different curve BN254.\
            \ The circuit for verifying a sin-\\\ngle Cosmos signature in the field\
            \ supported by Ethereum involves around 2 million gates, thus verifying\
            \ a\\\nblock (typically containing 32 signatures) will involve over 64\
            \ million gates, which is too big for existing\\\nzero-knowledge proofs\
            \ schemes.\\\nTo makezkBridgepractical, we propose two ideas.\\\nReducing\
            \ proof time withdeVirgoWe observe that the ZKP circuit for verifying\
            \ multiple signatures is\\\ncomposed of multiple copies of one sub-circuit.\
            \ Our first idea is to take advantage of this special structure\\\nand\
            \ distribute proof generation across multiple servers. We propose a noveldistributed\
            \ ZKP protocoldubbed\\\ndeVirgo, which carefully parallelizes the Virgo\
            \ \\[ZXZS20\\] protocol, one of the fastest ZKP systems (in terms\\\n\
            of prover time) without a trusted setup. WithdeVirgo, we can accelerate\
            \ proof generation inzkBridgewith\\\nperfect linear scalability. We will\
            \ dive into the detail ofdeVirgoin Section 5.4.\\\nReducing on-chain cost\
            \ by recursive verification.While verifyingdeVirgoproofs on ordinary CPUs\
            \ is\\\nvery efficient, on-chain verification is still costly. To further\
            \ reduce the on-chain verification cost (compu-\\\ntation and storage),\
            \ we userecursive verification: the prover recursively proves the correctness\
            \ of a (poten-\\\ntially large) Virgo proof using a smart-contract-friendly\
            \ zero-knowledge protocol to get a small and verifier-\\\nefficient proof.\
            \ At a high level, we trade slightly increased proof generation time for\
            \ much reduced on-chain\\\nverification cost: the proof size reduces from200+KB\
            \ to131bytes, and the required computation reduces\\\nfrom infeasible\
            \ amount of gas to210K gas. We will present more detail of recursive verification\
            \ in Sec-\\\ntion 5.5.\\\n5.4 Distributed proof generation\\\nAs observed\
            \ previously, the opportunity for fast prover time stems from the fact\
            \ that the circuit for verifyingN\\\nsignatures consists ofNcopies of\
            \ identical sub-circuits. This type of circuits is called data-parallel\
            \ \\[Tha15\\].\\\nThe advantage of data-parallel circuits is that there\
            \ is no connection among different sub-copies. Therefore,\\\neach copy\
            \ can be handled separately. We consider accelerating the proof generation\
            \ on such huge circuits\\\nby dealing with each sub-circuit in parallel.\
            \ In this section, we propose a distributed zk-SNARK protocol on\\\ndata-parallel\
            \ circuits.\\\nThere are many zero knowledge proofs protocols \\[ZXZS20;\
            \ XZZPS19b; Set20; WTSTW18; BSCTV14c;\\\nBSCRSVW19; AHIV17; BSBHR19; Zha+21a;\
            \ GWC19b; COS20\\] supporting our computation. We choose\\\nVirgo as the\
            \ underlying ZKP protocols for two reasons: 1. Virgo does not need a trusted\
            \ setup and is plausi-\\\nbly post-quantum secure. 2. Virgo is one of\
            \ the fastest protocols with succinct verification time and succinct\\\
            \nproof size for problems in large scale. We present a new distributed\
            \ version of Virgo for data-parallel arith-\\\nmetic circuits achieving\
            \ optimal scalability without any overhead on the proof size. Specifically,\
            \ our protocol\\\nofdeVirgoon data-parallel circuits withNcopies usingNparallel\
            \ machines isNtimes faster than the orig-\\\ninal Virgo while the proof\
            \ size remains the same. Our scheme is of independent interest and is\
            \ possible to\\\nbe used in other Virgo-based systems to improve the efficiency.\\\
            \nWe provide the overall description ofdeVirgoas follows. Suppose the\
            \ prover hasNmachines in total,\\\nlabeled fromP\\\n0\\\ntoP\\\nN−1\\\n\
            . AssumeP\\\n0\\\nis the master node while other machines are ordinary\
            \ nodes. AssumeV\\\nis the verifier. Given a data-parallel arithmetic\
            \ circuit consisting ofNidentical structures, the naïve algorithm\\\n\
            of the distributed Virgo is to assign each sub-circuit to a separate node.\
            \ Then each node runs Virgo to generate\\\nthe proof separately. The concatenation\
            \ ofNproofs is the final proof. Unfortunately, the proof size in this\\\
            \n115\\\n\\\nnaive algorithm scales linearly in the number of sub-circuits,\
            \ which can be prohibitively large for data-parallel\\\ncircuits with\
            \ many sub-copies. To address the problem, our approach removes the additional\
            \ factor ofNin\\\nthe proof size by aggregating messages and proofs among\
            \ distributed machines. Specifically, the original\\\nprotocol of Virgo\
            \ consists of two major building blocks. One is the GKR protocol \\[GKR15\\\
            ], which consists\\\nofdsumcheck protocols \\[LFKN92\\] for a circuit\
            \ of depthd. The other is the polynomial commitment (PC)\\\nscheme. We\
            \ design distributed schemes for each of the sumcheck and the polynomial\
            \ commitment (PC). In\\\nour distributed sumcheck protocol, a master nodeP\\\
            \n0\\\naggregates messages from all machines, then sends\\\nthe aggregated\
            \ message toVin every round, instead of sending messages from all machines\
            \ directly toV.\\\nOur protocol for distributed sumcheck has exactly the\
            \ same proof size as the original sumcheck protocol,\\\nthus saving a\
            \ factorNover the naïve distributed protocol. Additionally, in our distributed\
            \ PC protocol, we\\\noptimize the commitment phase and makeP\\\n0\\\n\
            aggregateNcommitments into one instead of sendingN\\\ncommitments directly\
            \ toV. During the opening phase, the proof can also be aggregated, which\
            \ improves the\\\nproof size by a logarithmic factor in the size of the\
            \ polynomial.\\\nWe present preliminaries in Section 5.4.1, the detail\
            \ of the distributed sumcheck protocol in Section 5.4.2\\\nand the detail\
            \ of the distributed PC protocol in Section 5.4.3. We combine them all\

            \nBackground: the sumcheck protocol.The sumcheck problem is to sum a multivariate\
            \ polynomialf:\\\nF\\\nℓ\\\n→Fover all binary inputs:\\\n∑\\\nb\\\n1\\\
            \n,···,b\\\nℓ\\\n∈{0,1}\\\nf(b\\\n1\\\n,···, b\\\nℓ\\\n). The sumcheck\
            \ protocol allows the proverP\\\nto convince the verifierVthat the summation\
            \ isHvia a sequence of interactions, and the formal protocol is\\\npresented\
            \ in Protocol 8.\\\nThe high-level idea of the sumcheck protocol is to\
            \ divide the verification intoℓrounds. In each round, the\\\nprover only\
            \ sends a univariate polynomial to the verifier. The verifier checks the\
            \ correctness of the polynomial\\\nby a single equation. Then this variable\
            \ will be replaced by a random point sampled by the verifier. As there\\\
            \nare totallyℓvariables inf, afterℓrounds, the claim about the summation\
            \ will be reduced to a claim aboutf\\\non a random vectorr. Given the\
            \ oracle access tofon a random vector, the verifier can check the last\
            \ claim.\\\nThe GKR protocol.We follow the convention in prior works of\
            \ GKR protocols \\[CMT12; Tha13b;\\\nZGKPP17d; XZZPS19b; ZXZS20\\]. We\

            ). The oracle access can be instantiated byPC.\\\n⌈logS\\\ni\\\n⌉. (For\
            \ simplicity, we assumeS\\\ni\\\nis a power of 2, and we can pad the layer\
            \ with dummy gates oth-\\\nerwise.) We then define a functionV\\\ni\\\n\

            \ by Equation 5.4 in the GKR protocol, which have the same form as\\\n\
            fdefined onC. The naïve approach is running the sumcheck protocol on these\
            \ polynomials separately. As\\\nthere areNproofs in total and each size\
            \ isO(ℓ−n), the total proof size will beO(N(ℓ−n)). To reduce\\\nthe proof\
            \ size back toℓ, the prover needs to aggregateNproofs to generate a single\
            \ proof onf. We observe\\\nthat the sumcheck protocol on data-parallel\
            \ circuits satisfiesf\\\n(i)\\\n(x) =f(x,i). As shown in Protocol 8, the\\\
            \nprotocol proceeds forℓvariables round by round. We first run the sumcheck\
            \ protocol on variables that are\\\nirrelevant to the index of sub-copies\
            \ in the circuit. In the first(ℓ−n)rounds, each proverP\\\ni\\\ngenerates\

            \ thej-th round.\\\nThe aggregation among parallel machines reduces the\
            \ proof size to constant in each round. Hence the final\\\nproof size\
            \ is onlyO(ℓ). A similar approach has appeared in \\[WHGSW16\\]. The main\
            \ focus of \\[WHGSW16\\]\\\nwas improving the prover time of the sumcheck\
            \ protocol in the GKR protocol toO(2\\\nℓ\\\n(ℓ−n))for data-parallel\\\
            \ncircuits, which was later subsumed by \\[XZZPS19b\\] with a prover running\
            \ inO(2\\\nℓ\\\n)time. Instead, our scheme\\\nis focused on improving\
            \ the prover time byNtimes with distributed computing onNmachines without\
            \ any\\\noverhead on the proof size.\\\nWith this idea in mind, we rewrite\
            \ the sumcheck equation onfas follows.\\\nH=\\\n∑\\\nb∈{0,1}\\\nℓ\\\n\
            f(b) =\\\nN−1\\\n∑\\\ni\\\n=0\\\n∑\\\nb∈{0,1}\\\nℓ−n\\\nf\\\n(i)\\\n(b).\\\
            \nThen we divide the original sumcheck protocol onfinto 3 phases naturally\
            \ in the setting of distributed\\\ncomputing. We present the formal protocol\
            \ of distributed sumcheck in Protocol 10.\\\n1.From round 1 to round(ℓ−n)(step\

            and sends\\\nthe univariate polynomial toP\\\n0\\\n. After receiving all\
            \ univariate polynomials from other machines,P\\\n0\\\naggregates these\
            \ univariate polynomials by summing them together and sends the aggregated\
            \ univari-\\\nate polynomial to the verifier. WhenP\\\n0\\\nreceives a\
            \ random query from the verifier,P\\\n0\\\nrelays the\\\nrandom challenge\
            \ to all nodes as the random query of the current round.\\\n2.In round(ℓ−n)(step\
            \ 2 in Protocol 10), the polynomials off\\\n(0)\\\n,···, f\\\n(N−1)\\\n\

            \n.P\\\n0\\\nuses theseNpoints as an array to construct the\\\nmulti-linear\

            \ Therefore,\\\ndeVirgo still satisfies knowledge soundness.\\\nThe zero-knowledge\
            \ property is not necessary as there is no private witness in the setting\
            \ of zkbridge.\\\nHowever, we can achieve zero-knowledge for deVirgo by\
            \ adding some hiding polynomials. Virgo uses the\\\nsame method to achieve\
            \ zero-knowledge.\\\nAdditionally, Fiore and Nitulescu \\[FN16\\] introduced\
            \ the notion of O-SNARK for SNARK over authen-\\\nticated data such as\
            \ cryptographic signatures. Protocol 13 is an O-SNARK for any oracle family,\
            \ albeit in\\\nthe random oracle model. To see this, Virgo relies on the\
            \ construction of computationally sound proofs\\\nof Micali \\[Mic00\\\
            ] to achieve non-interactive proof and knowledge soundness in the random\
            \ oracle model,\\\nwhich has been proven to be O-SNARK in \\[FN16\\].\
            \ Hence Virgo is an O-SNARK, and so is deVirgo because\\\ndeVirgo also\
            \ relies on the same model.\\\nProtocol 13 achieves optimal linear scalability\
            \ on data-parallel circuits without significant overhead on\\\nthe proof\
            \ size. In particular, our protocol accelerates Virgo byNtimes givenNdistributed\
            \ machines. Addi-\\\ntionally, the proof size in our scheme is reduced\
            \ by a factor ofNcompared to the naïve solution of running\\\neach sub-copy\
            \ of data-parallel circuits separately and generatingNproofs. The complexity\
            \ of Protocol 13\\\nis shown in the following.\\\nComplexity of distributed\
            \ Virgo.Given a data-parallel layered arithmetic circuitCwithNsub-copies,\\\
            \neach havingdlayers andminputs, the total prover work of Protocol 13\
            \ isO(\\|C\\|+N mlogm). The prover\\\nwork for a single machine isO(\\\
            |C\\|/N+mlogm), and the total communication among machines isO(N m+\\\n\
            N dlog\\|C\\|). The proof size isO(dlog\\|C\\|+λ(N+ log\\\n2\\\nm)). The\
            \ verification cost isO(dlog\\|C\\|+λ(N+\\\nlog\\\n2\\\nm)).\\\n5.5 Reducing\
            \ proof size and verifier time\\\nAlthoughdeVirgoimproves the prover time\
            \ by orders of magnitude, we want to further reduce the cost of\\\nthe\
            \ verification time and the proof size. As mentioned in the above section,\
            \ the circuit which validates over\\\n100 signatures is giant due to non-compatible\
            \ instructions on different curves across different blockchains.\\\nAdditionally,\
            \ Virgo’s proof size, which is around 210KB for a circuit with 10 million\
            \ gates, is large in practice.\\\nThus we cannot postdeVirgo’s proof on-chain\
            \ and validate the proof directly. Aiming at smaller proof size\\\nand\
            \ simpler verification on-chain, we propose to further compress the proof\
            \ by recursive proofs with two\\\nlayers. Intuitively, for a large-scale\
            \ statement(x,w)∈Rin Definition 5.2.2, the prover generates the proof\\\
            \nπ\\\n1\\\nby a protocol with fast prover time in the first layer. If\
            \ the length ofπ\\\n1\\\nis not as short as desired, then\\\nthe prover\
            \ can produce a shorter proofπ\\\n2\\\nby invoking another protocol for(x,\
            \ π\\\n1\\\n)∈ R\\\n′\\\nin the second\\\nlayer, whereR\\\n′\\\nrepresents\
            \ thatπ\\\n1\\\nis a valid proof for(x,w)∈ R. To shrink the proof size\
            \ and simplify\\\n126\\\n\\\nthe verification as much as possible, we\
            \ choose Groth16 as the second layer ZKP protocol since Groth16\\\nhas\
            \ constant proof size and fast verification time. Moreover, the curve\
            \ in Groth16 is natively supported by\\\nEthereum, which is beneficial\
            \ for saving on-chain cost on Ethereum. In our approach, the prover invokes\\\
            \ndeVirgoto generateπ\\\n1\\\non the initial circuit in the first layer.\

            \ sumcheck part. Therefore, the recursive proof size and the recursive\
            \ ver-\\\nification cost are independent of the number of signatures to\
            \ validate in our instance. In addition, the prover\\\ntime of Groth16\
            \ on the verification circuit ofdeVirgois only 25% of the prover time\
            \ ofdeVirgoin practice.\\\nTherefore, our recursive proof scheme reduces\
            \ the on-chain proof verification cost from∼8×10\\\n7\\\ngas (an\\\nestimation)\
            \ to less than2.3×10\\\n5\\\ngas.\\\n5.6 Implementation and Evaluation\\\
            \nTo demonstrate the practicality ofzkBridge, we implement a prototype\
            \ from Cosmos \\[Cos\\] (a PoS blockchain\\\nbuilt on top of the Tendermint\
            \ \\[Kwo14\\] protocol) to Ethereum, and from Ethereum to other EVM-compatible\\\
            \nchains such as BSC. Supports for other blockchains can be similarly\
            \ implemented with additional engineering\\\neffort, as long as they support\
            \ light client protocols defined in Definition 5.2.1. In this section,\
            \ we discuss\\\nimplementation detail, its performance, as well as operational\
            \ cost.\\\n127\\\n\\\nThe bridge from Cosmos to Ethereum is realized with\
            \ the full blownzkBridgeprotocol presented so far\\\nto achieve practical\
            \ performance. In comparison, the direction from Ethereum to other EVM-compatible\\\
            \nchains incurs much less overhead for proof generation and does not requiredeVirgo.\
            \ Therefore, in what\\\nfollows, we mainly focus on the direction from\
            \ Cosmos to Ethereum.\\\n5.6.1 Implementation details\\\nThe bridge from\
            \ Cosmos to Ethereum consists of four components: a relayer that fetches\
            \ Cosmos block\\\nheaders and sends them to Ethereum (implemented in 300+\
            \ lines of Python),deVirgo(implemented in 10000+\\\nlines of C++) for\
            \ distributed proof generation, a handcrafted recursive verification circuit,\
            \ and an updater\\\ncontract on Ethereum (implemented in 600+ lines of\
            \ Solidity). Our signature verification circuit is based on\\\nthe optimized\
            \ signature verification circuit \\[Edd\\]. However, we use Gnark instead\
            \ of Circom as in \\[Edd\\] for\\\nbetter efficiency for proof generation.\\\
            \nGenerating correctness proofs.Relay nodes submit Cosmos block headers\
            \ to the updater contract on\\\nEthereum along with correctness proofs,\
            \ which proves that the block is properly signed by the Cosmos val-\\\n\
            idator committee appointed by the previous block. (In Cosmos a hash of\
            \ the validator committee members\\\nis included in the previous block.)\\\
            \nIn Cosmos, each block header contains about 128 EdDSA signatures (on\
            \ Curve25519), Merkle roots for\\\ntransactions and states, along with\
            \ other metadata, where32top signatures are required to achieve super-\\\
            \nmajority stakes. However, the most efficient curve supported by the\
            \ Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is\\\nBN254. To verify Cosmos digital\
            \ signatures in EVM, one must simulate Curve25519 on curve BN254,\\\n\
            which will lead to large circuits. Concretely, to verify a Cosmos block\
            \ header (mainly, to verify about 32\\\nsignatures), we need about\\\n\
            64 milliongates. We implementdeVirgo(Section 5.4) and recursive verification\\\
            \n(Section 5.5) to accelerate proof generation and verification.\\\nMoreover,\
            \ in practical deployment, multiple relayers can form a pipeline to increase\
            \ the throughput.\\\nLooking ahead, based on the evaluation results, our\
            \ implementation can handle1second block time in Cos-\\\nmos with120+capable\
            \ relayers in the network.\\\nFor proof verification, we build an outer\
            \ circuit that verifies Virgo proofs and use Gnark \\[Gna\\] to generate\\\
            \nthe final Groth16 proof that can be efficiently verified by the updater\
            \ contract on Ethereum.\\\nThe updater contract.We implement the updater\
            \ contract on Ethereum in Solidity that verifies Groth16\\\nproofs and\
            \ keeps a list of the Cosmos block headers in its persistent storage.\
            \ The cost of verifying a Groth16\\\nproof on-chain is less than230Kgas.\\\
            \nThe updater contract exposes a simple API which takes block height as\
            \ its input, and returns the corre-\\\nsponding block header. The receiver\
            \ contracts can then use the block header to complete application-specific\\\
            \nverification.\\\nBatching.Instead of calling the updater contract on\
            \ every new block header, we implementedbatching\\\nwhere the updater\
            \ contract stores Merkle roots of batches ofBconsecutive block headers.\
            \ The prover will\\\nfirst collectBconsecutive blocks, and then makes\
            \ a unified proof for allBblocks. The updater contract will\\\nonly need\
            \ to verify one proof for the batch ofBblocks. After the verification,\
            \ the updater contract checks\\\nthe difficulty, stores the block headers,\
            \ and updates the light-client state. Storing one Merkle root everyB\\\
            \nblocks also reduces storage cost. ThusBcan be set to balance user experience\
            \ and cost: With a largerB,\\\nusers need to wait longer, but the cost\
            \ of running the system is lower.\\\n128\\\n\\\nWe implement the aforementioned\
            \ batched proof verification and show the experimental results in Sec-\\\
            \ntion 5.6.2. With batching, the cost for storing block headers and maintaining\
            \ light-client states is amortized\\\nacrossBblocks. The bulk of the cost\
            \ incurred by the updater contract is SNARK proof verification, which\\\
            \nis the focus of our evaluation below.\\\nIn addition, we propose a more\
            \ complex batching optimization presented in the following for further\\\
            \noptimization.\\\nOn-chain Gas Cost OptimizationTo further optimize the\
            \ on-chain gas cost of block header verification\\\nand storage for a\
            \ universal zkBridge, we propose the following approach, in which the\
            \ prover will not bother\\\nto pay for on-chain proof verification or\
            \ block header storage, and users are encouraged to submit the proof\\\
            \nthey need by our incentive design.\\\nIn our optimization, the same\
            \ as the aforementioned batched proof, the prover generates one single\
            \ proof\\\nfor every2\\\nd\\\nblocks wheredis a system configuration,\
            \ and each proof checks and shows the validity of all\\\nsignatures in\
            \ the corresponding2\\\nd\\\nblocks. However, instead of submitting the\
            \ Merkle root of the batch along\\\nwith the proof on-chain immediately,\
            \ provers simply post the proof to the users (e.g., through a website),\
            \ and\\\nit’s up to the users to retrieve and post the proof on-chain.\
            \ Thus there’s no more on-chain gas cost for provers\\\nthrough the approach.\\\
            \nFor users who want to verify a transactiontxin a blockblk, the workflow\
            \ is as follows.\\\n1.Ifblkhas already been submitted on-chain, go to\
            \ the next step. Otherwise, retrieve the proofs for\\\nthe sequence of\
            \ blocks from the first unsubmitted one toblk, and then invoke the updater\
            \ contract to\\\nverify all the proofs on-chain and store the information\
            \ of the corresponding sequence of blocks. The\\\nprocess can be expensive.\
            \ However, once the proofs are verified and the blocks are confirmed by\
            \ the\\\nupdater contract, the user becomes the owner of all these proofs\
            \ on-chain, and can benefit from the\\\nproofs by charging later users\
            \ who rely on these proofs to verify their transactions on-chain.\\\n\
            2.Thanks to the previously submitted proofs, the validity of the corresponding\
            \ block is already proved\\\nat this step. And the work can never be accomplished\
            \ without the efforts of proving all the blocks\\\nprior toblk(includingblk).\
            \ Supposeblkis thei\\\nth\\\nblock, then for each block with index in\
            \ the range\\\n\\[i−t+ 1, i\\], the user should pay a certain amount of\
            \ fee to the block proof owner in compensation,\\\nwheretis a system configuration\
            \ and the definition of block proof owner is defined in the previous\\\
            \nstep.\\\nIn this case, provers don’t bother to pay for on-chain verification\
            \ any more, and the proofs are only\\\nsubmitted and verified on demand,\
            \ which is more cost-efficient and can reduce possible waste. Moreover,\\\
            \nthrough carefully-designed incentive, we can actually encourage users\
            \ to submit the proofs as a possible\\\ninvestment, and it can also help\
            \ with the popularity of our bridge.\\\nThrough the optimization, the\
            \ cost performance of our bridge can be summarized as follows. If there\
            \ is\\\nhigh demand, then each proof will be submitted immediately upon\
            \ generation, and in this case each user needs\\\nto pay for at most one\
            \ time of on-chain proof verification. It then degenerates into our original\
            \ batched proof,\\\nbut users are responsible of paying for the on-chain\
            \ verification instead. If the sender chain is so unpopular\\\nthat there\
            \ is little bridging demand from the chain, then we successfully avoid\
            \ unnecessarily submitting the\\\nproofs on-chain for meaningless but\
            \ costly verification. And even if a user suddenly exists and requires\\\
            \nbridging in this case, the request can also be fulfilled by retrieving\
            \ the proofs from provers and sending them\\\nfor on-chain verification\
            \ one by one.\\\nAnd thus we can see that, the new design can actually\
            \ benefit both the provers and the users.\\\n129\\\n\\\n5.6.2 Evaluation\\\
            \nWe evaluate the performance ofzkBridge(from Cosmos to Ethereum) from\
            \ four aspects: proof generation\\\ntime, proof generation communication\

            \ We run both protocols on the same circuit for\\\ncorrectness proofs,\

            \nFigure 5.2 shows the prover time (in seconds) against differentN. FordeVirgo,\
            \ we repeat the experiment\\\nwith8,32,128distributed machines. According\
            \ to Fig. 5.2, the prover time of the original Virgo increases\\\nlinearly\
            \ in the number of signaturesN, while the prover time ofdeVirgois almost\
            \ independent ofNuntilNis\\\ngreater than the number of servers when computation\
            \ becomes an bottleneck. The linear scalability suggests\\\nthat the workload\
            \ of each machine only depends on its own sub-circuit and the communication\
            \ overhead\\\nis small. Table 5.2 reports the communication cost among\
            \ parallel machines. The total communication\\\ncost is linear in the\
            \ number of machines, consistent with the analysis in Section 5.4.4, with\

            \ Cosmos block headers typically haveN= 128signatures while32top signatures\

            \ number of signatures verified by thedeVirgoproofs. That is because\\\
            \nof the data-parallel structure of the state transition proof circuit:\
            \ the size of Groth16 verification circuit is\\\nonly a function of the\
            \ size of a sub-circuit.\\\nThe main benefit of recursive verification\
            \ is a reduction in both proof size and verification cost.\\\nReduced\
            \ proof size.Table 5.2 shows the proof size both with and without recursive\
            \ verification. For the\\\npractical scenario whereN= 32, the proof size\
            \ is reduced from\\\n1.9MB to 131 Bytes. Overall, forN= 32,\\\nwith an\
            \ increase of about25%in prover time, we get a reduction of around14000x\
            \ in proof size.\\\nReduced on-chain verification cost.The final proof\
            \ is 131 Bytes while the final verification only costs3\\\npairings. As\
            \ shown in Table 5.2, the on-chain verification cost is constant (227K).\
            \ In comparison, without\\\nrecursive verification, directly verifying\
            \ Virgo proofs on-chain would be infeasible. (Our estimation of the\\\n\
            gas cost is\\\n78M, which far exceeds the single block gas limit 30M).\\\
            \nComparison with optimistic bridges.With batching, the confirmation latency\
            \ ofzkBridgeis under2min-\\\nutes, including3×32seconds for waiting for\
            \ all blocks in the batch and another20seconds for proof\\\ngeneration.\
            \ While this is not blazing fast, in comparison, optimistic bridges have\
            \ much longer confirmation\\\ntime. E.g., NEAR’s Rainbow bridge has a\
            \ challenge window of4hours \\[Nea\\] before which the transfer\\\ncannot\
            \ be confirmed.\\\n131\\\n\\\n5.6.3 Cost analysis\\\nIn this section,\
            \ we analyze the operational cost ofzkBridge, which consists of off-chain\
            \ cost (generating\\\nproofs) and on-chain cost (storing headers and verifying\
            \ proofs).\\\nOff-chain cost.Off-chain cost can vary significantly based\
            \ on the deployment. While we use AWS in our\\\nperformance benchmark,\
            \ it may not be the best option for practical deployment. AWS service\
            \ is expensive\\\ndue to its high margin, elastic scaling capability,\
            \ and high reliability, which isn’t necessary for our proof\\\ngeneration\
            \ process. To show a representative range, we consider two deployment\
            \ options: cloud-based and\\\nself-hosted. For cloud-based deployment,\
            \ we search for reputable and economical dedicated server rental\\\nservices\
            \ and choose Hetzner\\[Het\\] as an example. For self-hosted options,\
            \ we calculate the cost to purchase\\\nthe hardware and the on-going cost\
            \ (mainly the electricity).\\\nOn AWS c5.24xlarge, it takes18seconds to\
            \ generate a proof with32machines. Renting a server with\\\na similar\
            \ spec as AWS c5.24xlarge from Hetzner costs $253.12 per month, thus the\
            \ cost of cloud-based\\\ndeployment with Hetzner will be around $8100\
            \ per month for all 32 machines. It translates to $0.02 per\\\nblock.\\\
            \nTo estimate the cost for self-hosted deployment, we use online tools\
            \ to configure a machine with a com-\\\nparable spec to that in AWS. Table\
            \ 5.3 reports the configuration and each machine costs around $4.5k. The\\\
            \ntotal setup cost is thus around $4.5k×32 = $144k. For self-hosted servers,\
            \ the main on-going cost is elec-\\\ntricity. With each machine consuming657W\
            \ power, a32-machine cluster consumes0.105kWh per block.\\\nAssuming US\
            \ average electricity rate$0.12/KWh \\[Use\\], the electricity cost is\
            \ $0.012per block, or $5184\\\nper month.\\\nHardware typeHardware namePowerPriceQuantity\\\

            \ price (about1600USD) at the time of writing\\\n(August 2022). If we\
            \ use efficient batched proofs, for a batch ofNheaders, the bulk of the\
            \ verification cost\\\nis that of verifying one Groth16 proof, which costs\
            \ less than230Kgas, roughly $7.36. If we chooseN= 32\\\nfor example, the\
            \ on-chain cost will be $0.23per block. Moreover, if we adopt the optimization\
            \ mentioned in\\\nSection 5.6.1, we can further reduce the on-chain cost\
            \ and offload the cost to users if the number of users is\\\nlarge.\\\n\
            132\\\n\\\n5.6.4 Ethereum to other EVM-compatible chains\\\nSo far we\
            \ have focused on the bridge from Cosmos to Ethereum because generating\
            \ and verifying correctness\\\nproofs for that direction is challenging.\
            \ We also implement a prototype of a bridge from Ethereum to other\\\n\
            EVM-compatible blockchains.\\\nThe high level idea is simple: upon receiving\
            \ a block header, the updater contract on the receiver chain\\\nverifies\
            \ the PoW and appends it to the list of headers if the verification is\
            \ passed. However, a wrinkle to\\\nthe implementation is that Ethereum\
            \ uses a memory hard hash function, EthHash \\[Woo+14\\], which is pro-\\\
            \nhibitively inefficient to run on-chain. Basically, EthHash involves\
            \ randomly accessing elements in a 1 giga-\\\nbyte dataset (called a DAG)\
            \ derived from a public seed and the block height. Generating the DAGs\
            \ on-chain\\\nis prohibitively expensive.\\\nOur idea is to pre-compute\
            \ many DAGs off-chain and store their hashes on-chain. Specifically, as\
            \ part of\\\nzkBridgesetup, we pre-compute 2,048 DAGs , build a Merkle\
            \ tree for each DAG using MiMC \\[AGRRT16\\],\\\nand store the Merkle\
            \ roots on-chain. Per EthHash specification, a new DAG is generated every\
            \ 30,000 blocks,\\\nso 2,048 of them can last for 10 years; the off-chain\
            \ pre-computation process takes no more than 4 days. Then,\\\nthe correctness\
            \ proofs will show that a given EthHash PoW is correct with respect to\
            \ the Merkle root of the\\\nDAG corresponding to the block in question.\
            \ We emphasize that the setup process is verifiable and anyone\\\ncan\
            \ verify the published Merkle roots on their own before using the service.\
            \ The circuit for verifying EthHash\\\nPoW has around2million gates.\\\
            \nThe rest of the protocol is the same as a regular light client, which\
            \ involves storing the headers, following\\\nthe longest chain by computing\
            \ accumulated difficulty, resolving forks, etc.\\\nCost analysis.Since\
            \ EthHash PoW verification circuit has only around2million constraints,\
            \ a single ma-\\\nchine with the configuration in Table 5.3 can generate\
            \ a proof within 10 seconds. As long as the receiver\\\nchain is EVM-compatible,\
            \ the on-chain cost will be close to that presented in Section 5.6.3,\
            \ since the updater\\\ncontract only verifies Groth16 proofs in all cases.\\\
            \n5.7 Related work\\\nIn this section, we comparezkBridgeto existing cross-chain\
            \ bridge systems and the line of work on zk-rollups\\\nwhich also uses\
            \ ZKPs for scalability and security.\\\nCross-chain bridges in the wild\
            \ and security issues.Cross-chain systems are widely deployed and used.\\\
            \nBelow we briefly survey the representative ones. The list is not meant\
            \ to be exhaustive. PolyNetwork \\[Polb\\]\\\nis an interoperability protocol\
            \ using a side-chain as the relay with a two-phase commitment protocol.\
            \ Worm-\\\nhole \\[Worb\\] is a generic message-passing protocol secured\
            \ by a network of guardian nodes, and its security\\\nrelies on\\\n2\\\
            \n3\\\nof the committee being honest. Ronin operates in a similar model.\
            \ While relying on decentral-\\\nized committees for security, practical\
            \ deployment usually opts for relatively small ones for efficiency (e.g.,\\\
            \n9 in case of Ronin). Committee breaches are far from being rare in practice.\
            \ In a recent exploit against\\\nRonin \\[Ron\\], the attacker obtained\
            \ five of the nine validator keys, stealing 624 million USD. PolyNetwork\\\
            \nand Wormhole were also recently attacked, losing $611m \\[Pola\\] and\
            \ $326m \\[Wora\\] respectively. Key com-\\\npromise was suspected in\
            \ the PolyNetwork attack.\\\nAn alternative design is to leverage economic\
            \ incentives. Nomad \\[Nomb\\] (which recently lost more than\\\n$190m\
            \ to hackers due to an implementation bug \\[Noma\\]) and Near’s Rainbow\
            \ Bridge \\[Rai\\] are such exam-\\\nples. These systems require participants\
            \ to deposit a collateral, and rely on a watchdog service to continuously\\\
            \n133\\\n\\\nmonitor the blockchain and confiscate offenders’ collateral\
            \ upon detecting invalid updates. Optimistic pro-\\\ntocols fundamentally\
            \ require a long confirmation latency in order to ensure invalid updates\
            \ can be detected\\\nwith high probability (e.g., Near \\[Rai\\] requires\
            \ 4 hours). Moreover, participants must deposit significantly\\\ncollateral\
            \ (e.g., 20 ETH in Near \\[Rai\\]). Both issues can be avoided byzkBridge.\\\
            \nIn summary, compared to existing protocols,zkBridgeachieve both efficiency\
            \ and cryptographic assur-\\\nance.zkBridgeis “trustless” in that it does\
            \ not require extra assumptions other than those of blockchains and\\\n\
            underlying cryptographic protocols. It also avoids the long confirmation\
            \ of optimistic protocols.\\\nzk-rollups.Rollups are protocols that batch\
            \ transaction execution using ZKPs to scale up the layer-1\\\nblockchains.\
            \ Starkware \\[Sta\\], ZkSync \\[Zks\\], and Polygon Zero \\[Pole\\] are\
            \ a few examples.\\\nThese zk-rollup solutions have not been applied to\
            \ the bridge setting, where our work is the first to use\\\nZKP to enable\
            \ a decentralized trustless bridge. In addition, the current zk-rollup\
            \ work in general has not\\\ndealt with such large circuits as inzkBridge,\
            \ whereas in our work, we need to design and develop a number\\\nof techniques\
            \ includingdeVirgoand proof recursion to make building a ZKP-based bridge\
            \ practical for the\\\nfirst time. In particular, we leverage the data\
            \ parallelism of the circuits to obtain a ZKP protocol that is more\\\n\
            than 100x faster than existing protocols for the workload inzkBridgeand\
            \ combine it with proof recursion for\\\nefficient on-chain verification.\
            \ The idea behinddeVirgoprotocol may be applicable to zk-rollups too.\\\

            # How does Heurist boost AI Agents'' computing power?


            Intermediate


            BlockchainAI


            11/18/2024, 7:54:51 PM


            Heurist is a decentralized AI cloud computing protocol offering premium
            infrastructure for future crypto users and AI developers. Through its

            By developing highly customized Web3 AI models, Heurist propels the growth
            of blockchain-based AI Agents. With plans to issue tokens in Q4 2024 and
            roll out various features throughout 2025, Heurist aims to become a crucial
            link between AI technology and the future.


            Forward the Original Title: With AI narratives taking the lead, how does
            Heurist contribute to enhancing the computation of needs for Agents?


            What kind of excellent infrastructure will Heurist bring to future crypto
            users and AI developers?


            In the future cyber society, AI will be an important part of human interaction,
            and its infrastructure construction will naturally become a key breakthrough
            for development. The demand for massive computing and inference services
            generated by model operations is also booming. As an AI-as-a-Service infrastructure
            in the Web3 field, the decentralized AI cloud computing protocol Heurist
            recently announced the completion of $2 million in financing from Amber
            Group, Contango Digital, Manifold Trading, Selini Capital and other institutions.
            What kind of excellent infrastructure will they bring to future crypto
            users and AI developers?


            ## Infrastructure


            With generative AI booming, the global market is projected to reach $356.1
            billion by 2030. This growth is accompanied by a rapid increase in demand
            for computing resources and inference services.


            ![](https://s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/gimg.gateimg.com/learn/e372b17a58919477c164eda8332d5cee286c5d49.png)


            Today, many AI models run on traditional centralized cloud services, and
            access to these services has the following problems:


            - Centralization risk: In centralized cloud services, all data and computations
            are concentrated in a single data center, which is susceptible to single
            points of failure. Additionally, all data is stored in a single location,
            increasing the risk of data leakage and misuse.

            - Higher cost: Running AI models requires a lot of computing resources,
            especially when training large models, which consumes a lot of GPU and
            CPU resources. The cost of these resources is high, especially for businesses
            that need to continuously run and update models, resulting in high operating
            costs in the long term.

            - Low resource utilization: In traditional centralized cloud services,
            due to the uneven load of AI model training and inference, there is a
            shortage of resources during busy times and a waste of resources during
            idle times. Furthermore, due to possible resource contention between services,
            resources cannot be fully utilized, further reducing resource utilization.


            As an AI-as-a-service infrastructure, Heurist uses the DePIN protocol
            architecture to allow GPU owners to provide computing resources permissionlessly,
            and offers APIs to allow users and developers to access and run AI models
            based on these computing resources.


            ### Computing Layer


            The computing layer consists of computing nodes, Pods and a verification
            system. Computing nodes serve as the basic unit and allow computing providers
            (miners) to join permissionlessly and with no fixed period.


            ![](https://s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/gimg.gateimg.com/learn/5439d743b4acd35dcebcd2c4e02fbfbe5db36ceb.png)


            Pod Architecture


            Pod is an independent deployable workload unit using GPU. Through Pod,
            users can specify certain computing requirements to match the corresponding
            nodes. It supports automatic load adjustment and can be used in AI model
            operation, fine-tuning and ZK proof generation. Heurist employs cryptographic
            economic verification to ensure the integrity and reliability of calculation
            results.


            ### Orchestration Layer


            Heurist developed the ZK Stack to provide a high-throughput and low-cost
            environment while offering users sovereign isolation for interoperability,
            ensuring operational and resource management stability. Additionally,
            for the on-chain sequencer, transaction calculations are executed off-chain
            first, and then uploaded to the chain after successful calculation and
            execution. This execution mode reduces the execution cost of failed transactions.


            ![](https://s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/gimg.gateimg.com/learn/19e7ed22efa651081b6766592de76ad00bf9a4e9.png)


            ### Application Layer


            Any user can build a front-end on the application layer, and Heurist provides
            two payment gateway modes. Developers can either prepay for certain resources
            using calculation points, or they can pay directly based on user usage
            by distributing the cost to users. The latter can also provide autonomous
            payment options for AI Agents.


            ![](https://s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/gimg.gateimg.com/learn/2474c7225f60cb0292f041bfb4b99071108e7e71.png)


            In summary, the advantage of Heurist is that its decentralized architecture
            improves the system’s fault resistance and data security, while reducing
            operating costs by utilizing idle computing resources, dynamic resource
            allocation improves resource utilization, and the load adjustment function
            enhances the system The flexibility and scalability, and the crypto-economic
            verification built by ZK Stack ensure the integrity and reliability of
            the calculation results, enabling the entire system to efficiently and

            Forward the Original Title: With AI narratives taking the lead, how does
            Heurist contribute to enhancing the computation of needs for Agents?


            What kind of excellent infrastructure will Heurist bring to future crypto
            users and AI developers?


            In the future cyber society, AI will be an important part of human interaction,
            and its infrastructure construction will naturally become a key breakthrough
            for development. The demand for massive computing and inference services
            generated by model operations is also booming. As an AI-as-a-Service infrastructure
            in the Web3 field, the decentralized AI cloud computing protocol Heurist
            recently announced the completion of $2 million in financing from Amber
            Group, Contango Digital, Manifold Trading, Selini Capital and other institutions.
            What kind of excellent infrastructure will they bring to future crypto
            users and AI developers?


            ## Infrastructure


            With generative AI booming, the global market is projected to reach $356.1
            billion by 2030. This growth is accompanied by a rapid increase in demand
            for computing resources and inference services.


            ![](https://s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/gimg.gateimg.com/learn/e372b17a58919477c164eda8332d5cee286c5d49.png)


            Today, many AI models run on traditional centralized cloud services, and
            access to these services has the following problems:


            - Centralization risk: In centralized cloud services, all data and computations
            are concentrated in a single data center, which is susceptible to single
            points of failure. Additionally, all data is stored in a single location,
            increasing the risk of data leakage and misuse.

            - Higher cost: Running AI models requires a lot of computing resources,
            especially when training large models, which consumes a lot of GPU and
            CPU resources. The cost of these resources is high, especially for businesses
            that need to continuously run and update models, resulting in high operating
            costs in the long term.

            - Low resource utilization: In traditional centralized cloud services,
            due to the uneven load of AI model training and inference, there is a
            shortage of resources during busy times and a waste of resources during
            idle times. Furthermore, due to possible resource contention between services,
            resources cannot be fully utilized, further reducing resource utilization.


            As an AI-as-a-service infrastructure, Heurist uses the DePIN protocol
            architecture to allow GPU owners to provide computing resources permissionlessly,
            and offers APIs to allow users and developers to access and run AI models
            based on these computing resources.


            ### Computing Layer


            The computing layer consists of computing nodes, Pods and a verification
            system. Computing nodes serve as the basic unit and allow computing providers
            (miners) to join permissionlessly and with no fixed period.


            ![](https://s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/gimg.gateimg.com/learn/5439d743b4acd35dcebcd2c4e02fbfbe5db36ceb.png)


            Pod Architecture


            Pod is an independent deployable workload unit using GPU. Through Pod,
            users can specify certain computing requirements to match the corresponding
            nodes. It supports automatic load adjustment and can be used in AI model
            operation, fine-tuning and ZK proof generation. Heurist employs cryptographic
            economic verification to ensure the integrity and reliability of calculation
            results.


            ### Orchestration Layer


            Heurist developed the ZK Stack to provide a high-throughput and low-cost
            environment while offering users sovereign isolation for interoperability,
            ensuring operational and resource management stability. Additionally,
            for the on-chain sequencer, transaction calculations are executed off-chain
            first, and then uploaded to the chain after successful calculation and
            execution. This execution mode reduces the execution cost of failed transactions.


            ![](https://s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/gimg.gateimg.com/learn/19e7ed22efa651081b6766592de76ad00bf9a4e9.png)


            ### Application Layer


            Any user can build a front-end on the application layer, and Heurist provides
            two payment gateway modes. Developers can either prepay for certain resources
            using calculation points, or they can pay directly based on user usage
            by distributing the cost to users. The latter can also provide autonomous
            payment options for AI Agents.


            ![](https://s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/gimg.gateimg.com/learn/2474c7225f60cb0292f041bfb4b99071108e7e71.png)


            In summary, the advantage of Heurist is that its decentralized architecture
            improves the system’s fault resistance and data security, while reducing
            operating costs by utilizing idle computing resources, dynamic resource
            allocation improves resource utilization, and the load adjustment function
            enhances the system The flexibility and scalability, and the crypto-economic
            verification built by ZK Stack ensure the integrity and reliability of
            the calculation results, enabling the entire system to efficiently and
            securely adapt to various workload requirements, providing users and developers
            with a stable experience.


            ## Products and Applications

            And Heurist released the community Heurist Imaginaries NFT, a series of
            500 AI-generated artworks in its early construction phase. The airdrop
            plan includes distributing a total of 1.75% of HEU tokens to holders of
            this series.

            as Aethir, Exabits, Spheron and Mintair to provide powerful computing
            resources and provide a foundation for AI model training and inference
            network construction. In the field of AI and data infrastructure, Heurist
            has established partnerships with GenLayer, Chasm Network, Aizel, and
            Gateway Network to ensure the efficient flow and security of data.


            For consumer applications, Heurist partners with companies such as CreatorBid,
            Arbus AI, DecentAI and Eden Art to bring AI technology to the broader
            consumer market. In terms of applications in the field of AI Agent, Heurist
            provides customized graph models for CreatorBid, especially customized
            services for the WallStreetBets brand. Through these collaborations, the

            ## Conclusion


            The future cyber society will rely more on the interaction between AI
            and humans. Heurist addresses the issues of centralization risks, high
            costs, and low resource utilization associated with traditional centralized
            cloud services. It also introduces a novel approach for AI developers
            and users to utilize computing resources. Heurist is poised to become
            a bridge connecting AI technology and the future, driving societal development
            in a more intelligent direction. It aims to provide robust technical support
            for building a more intelligent, interconnected, and secure cyber society.

            [4](https://messari.io/news?id=a8a30ccf-02e6-4606-a120-93575db2ef83).


            ### Core Features


            - **Decentralized AI Cloud & Compute**: Heurist coordinates GPU and data
            center resources worldwide, supporting dynamic scaling for high-demand
            AI tasks, including large language model inference, generative image/video
            AI, and complex data analytics.

            - **Elastic, Serverless Infrastructure**: It enables scalable, on-demand
            AI service consumption, allowing users to only pay for what they use.
            The HEU token powers the network''s incentives, governance, and economics[1](https://messari.io/project/heurist/profile)
            [3](https://messari.io/news?id=42e7e033-c28e-43a1-941b-82651aba15a3).

            - **AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) for Web3**: Web3 projects can tap into Heurist
            to run AI models, manage on-chain and off-chain agents, and access advanced
            data tools without centralized gatekeepers[1](https://messari.io/project/heurist/profile)
            [5](https://messari.io/news?id=da0decd8-2de7-479a-afb0-7ff946bee2e0).

            - **Developer Ecosystem**: Heurist provides open-source agent frameworks
            (notably for Python), easy integration toolkits, and a plug-and-play API
            for deploying AI within Web3 platforms, DeFi protocols, and NFT projects[2](https://messari.io/news?id=cb962146-8dfc-44ef-95aa-a74ef0f93e3f)
            [6](https://messari.io/news?id=0a138707-63bb-4428-8861-f328e79617e6).

            - **Permissionless Mining & Community Ownership**: Anyone with qualified
            hardware can contribute compute power to the network (become a "miner"),
            earn HEU tokens, and participate in decentralized governance[5](https://messari.io/news?id=da0decd8-2de7-479a-afb0-7ff946bee2e0)
            [3](https://messari.io/news?id=42e7e033-c28e-43a1-941b-82651aba15a3).

            - **Security & Partnerships**: Strategic alliances, such as with GoPlus
            Security, strengthen agent security and resilience in the decentralized
            infrastructure[7](https://messari.io/news?id=9c664702-b52c-4f58-bd91-8a97c5ca3569).

            - **No/Low Gas Fee Operations**: Thanks to integrations like with Zyfi,
            users can interact with Heurist’s AI services and mint assets like NFTs
            without incurring gas fees[8](https://messari.io/news?id=e6921be7-2556-4321-8347-6d89a35b5099)
            [9](https://messari.io/news?id=1b309fa4-e40f-4976-abb9-757e554e3f5c) [10](https://messari.io/news?id=7d59f502-79e7-40d7-9695-e2ee9029fffe).


            ### Use Cases


            - **AI Model Hosting & Inference**: Run and monetize fine-tuned generative
            models (text, image, video) on-chain or off-chain.

            - **Web3 Apps & DApps**: Level up decentralized applications with AI-powered
            agents, data analytics, and on-chain intelligence thanks to serverless
            compute.

            - **Decentralized Data Analysis**: Tools and infrastructure for researchers
            to visualize, manage, and analyze large datasets collaboratively.

            - **NFTs & Generative Art**: Platforms and events allow users to create
            AI-based generative art, mint as NFTs (e.g., zkImagine), and receive rewards[9](https://messari.io/news?id=1b309fa4-e40f-4976-abb9-757e554e3f5c)
            [10](https://messari.io/news?id=7d59f502-79e7-40d7-9695-e2ee9029fffe).

            - **Transparent & Community-Driven**: Open-source agents, roadmap transparency,
            and frequent community campaigns focus on maximizing decentralized participation[5](https://messari.io/news?id=da0decd8-2de7-479a-afb0-7ff946bee2e0)
            [11](https://messari.io/news?id=0fede0f4-d430-4065-bb39-1302cdd0f427).


            ### Roadmap & Ecosystem


            Heurist’s 2025 roadmap includes launches of mainnet (ZK Chain), advanced
            staking and governance, multi-dimensional revenue sharing, and system

            ## [​](https://docs.heurist.ai/introduction\#introducing-heurist)  Introducing
            Heurist


            Heurist is a decentralized AI-as-a-Service cloud. We aggregate compute
            resources from trusted DePIN partners to provide serverless AI services.
            Heurist’s API-first infrastructure elinimates the need for developers
            to manage GPU machines, and enables cost-efficient, censorship-free AI
            integration with APIs.


            ### [​](https://docs.heurist.ai/introduction\#key-offerings)  Key Offerings


            - **Serverless AI-as-a-Service**: Heurist abstracts away the complexities
            of hardware management. Use AI through intuitive APIs and SDKs with a
            few lines of code, saving the hassle of managing GPU machines. We support
            a wide range of models: LLMs, VLMs, Embedding Models, Image & Video Generation
            Models, and more. Learn more about our [Supported Model List](https://docs.heurist.ai/dev-guide/supported-models).


            - **Heurist Agent Framework**: Build your own AI agents that connect to
            Heurist services and interact with other agents. Our framework makes it
            easy to create agents that acquire crypto knowledge, manage social media
            accounts, and execute complex tasks autonomously.


            - **Heurist Mesh**: An open network of specialized AI agents that work
            together in a composable agent swarm. Each agent is purpose-built for
            specific tasks - analyzing token metrics, scanning smart contracts, processing
            onchain data, and more. Mesh agents are instantly accessible via REST
            APIs and MCP (Model Context Protocol). Community developers can contribute
            their own specialized agents, potentially earning per-use revenue. [Explore

            cloud platform, is committed to providing serverless AI services for developers
            by aggregating the computing power of individual GPU holders and data
            centers. This article will delve into the background, operation mechanism,
            token economics, market potential, and future prospects of Heurist.


            ## Project Introduction


            ![](https://s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/gimg.gateimg.com/learn/a3413cd555869856697a301a76efae45c45231e6.png)


            Heurist is a decentralized artificial intelligence as a service (AI-as-a-Service)
            cloud platform, aimed at providing serverless AI services by aggregating
            computing resources from individual GPU owners and data centers. Its API-first
            infrastructure eliminates the need for developers to manage GPU machines,
            making cost-effective and unreviewed AI integration possible through APIs.


            ## Loan Background


            Heurist has completed a $2 million Pre-Seed round of financing, with participation
            from institutions such as Amber Group, Contango Digital Assets, Manifold,

            ## Introducing decentralized artificial intelligence cloud


            1. True serverless AI: develop and deploy powerful models with minimal
            code, without the hassle of capacity planning and infrastructure.

            2. Dynamic resource allocation: each task is matched with its best hardware,
            the focus is still on building, not configuration.

            3. The infrastructure owned by the community: a network that provides
            built-in monetized incentives for participation through computing providers,
            developers, and the community, to coordinate in harmony for collective
            progress.


            ## Core Innovation


            1\. Elastic Stretch Protocol


            The market can only function at its best when the supply naturally meets
            the demand. The Heurist network grows with peak usage and scales down
            during quiet periods. When demand rises, incentive measures automatically
            attract more GPU computing power. When it decreases, resources are effectively
            reallocated.


            ![](https://s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/gimg.gateimg.com/learn/0c0d976a9b51db71a77f32638d6d8de30ec0973e.png)


            2\. Scalable Layer 2 Infrastructure


            Heurist is based on ZK Stack and leverages the latest advancements in
            blockchain scalability.


            - Lightning-fast transactions at only a small fraction of the cost of
            layer 1

            - Inherit the security of Ethereum through zero-knowledge proof.

            - Seamlessly integrated with the Elastic Chain ecosystem


            3\. Smart Request Routing


            Through analysis and matching, each computational request is matched with
            its perfect attribution:


            - Hardware requirements (VRAM, computational power)

            - Performance requirements

            - Budget Limit

            - Geographical preference


            4\. Zero Trust Computing


            Trust and verification are indispensable. Each task on Heurist is verified
            by mathematical proofs and achieved uncompromising reliability through
            encrypted verification.


            ## Heuristic Ecosystem


            The core of the Heurist ecosystem is a seamless network connecting three
            key participants:


            1. Developers: Instant access, unlimited scalability through Heurist unified
            API/SDK leveraging the power of open source AI. Start building in just
            a few lines of code, then easily scale with usage-based pricing. Serverless
            AI with no infrastructure burden.


            2. GPU owners: It is profitable to participate and turn idle GPUs into
            a stable income stream, similar to POW mining, but all computations serve
            real-world needs. Earn computational fees and protocol emissions by contributing
            resources to the Heurist network.


            3. User: Heurist, an AI tool designed for users, explores the potential
            of decentralized AI through a user-centric front-end package.

            ## Token Economics


            The token name of the Heurist project is HUE. As a utility token, its
            supply is dynamic and regulated through issuance and burning mechanisms.
            The maximum supply of HUE tokens is limited to 1 billion.


            Token distribution and issuance mechanisms can generally be divided into
            two types: mining and staking.


            - Mining: Users can mine HUE tokens by hosting AI models on their GPUs.
            Mining nodes require a minimum stake of 10,000 HUE or esHUE tokens to
            activate and will not receive rewards if the stake is below this value.
            The rewards for mining are in esHUE tokens, which are automatically compounded
            into the stake of the mining node. The reward rate depends on the GPU
            efficiency, normal operating time, the type of AI model being run, and
            the total stake in the node.

            - Staking: Users can stake HUE or esHUE tokens in miner nodes. The staking
            rewards are distributed in the form of HUE or esHUE tokens, with a higher
            yield for staking esHUE tokens than HUE tokens. Unlocking staked HUE tokens
            requires a 30-day lock-up period, while there is no lock-up period for
            unlocking staked esHUE. The esHUE rewards can be converted to HUE tokens
            over a linear release period of one year. Users can transfer their staked
            HUE or esHUE tokens from one miner node to another, promoting flexibility
            and competition among miners.


            The heuristic token distribution embodies the principles of fairness and
            community ownership, and its native token HEU can be used to pay for developers''
            computing resource costs, serve as the Gas cost for user transactions,
            and support staking and governance functions. In terms of allocation,
            50% is allocated to computing power providers, and early community distribution
            (including early miners and NFT holders) accounts for 7%. Heurist''s elastic
            token release rule dynamically adjusts the annual inflation rate between
            1.25% and 5%.

            Token burning mechanism


            Heurist implements a token burning mechanism, where a portion of HUE payment
            will be permanently removed from circulation when users pay for AI inference
            fees. The issuance and destruction of tokens are closely related to network
            activity. During periods of high usage, the token burn rate may exceed
            the issuance rate of new tokens, leading to a deflationary phase for the
            Heurist network. This mechanism helps regulate token supply and maintain
            token value in line with actual demand within the network.


            ## Summary

            is rapidly becoming an important driving force in various industries.
            With the popularization of AI technology, the demand for computing resources
            has also surged. Facing this challenge, Heurist, as a decentralized AI-as-a-Service
            cloud platform, is committed to providing serverless AI services for developers
            by aggregating the computing power of individual GPU holders and data
            centers. This article will delve into the background, operation mechanism,
            token economics, market potential, and future prospects of Heurist.


            ## Project Introduction


            ![](https://s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/gimg.gateimg.com/learn/a3413cd555869856697a301a76efae45c45231e6.png)


            Heurist is a decentralized artificial intelligence as a service (AI-as-a-Service)
            cloud platform, aimed at providing serverless AI services by aggregating
            computing resources from individual GPU owners and data centers. Its API-first
            infrastructure eliminates the need for developers to manage GPU machines,
            making cost-effective and unreviewed AI integration possible through APIs.


            ## Loan Background


            Heurist has completed a $2 million Pre-Seed round of financing, with participation
            from institutions such as Amber Group, Contango Digital Assets, Manifold,

            ![](https://s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/gimg.gateimg.com/learn/7838d0e05f41abec55990d30b90ea1b3491e10cb.png)


            ## Introducing decentralized artificial intelligence cloud


            1. True serverless AI: develop and deploy powerful models with minimal
            code, without the hassle of capacity planning and infrastructure.

            2. Dynamic resource allocation: each task is matched with its best hardware,
            the focus is still on building, not configuration.

            3. The infrastructure owned by the community: a network that provides
            built-in monetized incentives for participation through computing providers,
            developers, and the community, to coordinate in harmony for collective
            progress.


            ## Core Innovation


            1\. Elastic Stretch Protocol


            The market can only function at its best when the supply naturally meets
            the demand. The Heurist network grows with peak usage and scales down
            during quiet periods. When demand rises, incentive measures automatically
            attract more GPU computing power. When it decreases, resources are effectively
            reallocated.


            ![](https://s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/gimg.gateimg.com/learn/0c0d976a9b51db71a77f32638d6d8de30ec0973e.png)


            2\. Scalable Layer 2 Infrastructure


            Heurist is based on ZK Stack and leverages the latest advancements in
            blockchain scalability.


            - Lightning-fast transactions at only a small fraction of the cost of
            layer 1

            - Inherit the security of Ethereum through zero-knowledge proof.

            - Seamlessly integrated with the Elastic Chain ecosystem


            3\. Smart Request Routing


            Through analysis and matching, each computational request is matched with
            its perfect attribution:


            - Hardware requirements (VRAM, computational power)

            - Performance requirements

            - Budget Limit

            - Geographical preference


            4\. Zero Trust Computing


            Trust and verification are indispensable. Each task on Heurist is verified
            by mathematical proofs and achieved uncompromising reliability through
            encrypted verification.


            ## Heuristic Ecosystem


            The core of the Heurist ecosystem is a seamless network connecting three
            key participants:


            1. Developers: Instant access, unlimited scalability through Heurist unified
            API/SDK leveraging the power of open source AI. Start building in just
            a few lines of code, then easily scale with usage-based pricing. Serverless
            AI with no infrastructure burden.


            2. GPU owners: It is profitable to participate and turn idle GPUs into
            a stable income stream, similar to POW mining, but all computations serve
            real-world needs. Earn computational fees and protocol emissions by contributing
            resources to the Heurist network.


            3. User: Heurist, an AI tool designed for users, explores the potential
            of decentralized AI through a user-centric front-end package.

            ## Token Economics


            The token name of the Heurist project is HUE. As a utility token, its
            supply is dynamic and regulated through issuance and burning mechanisms.
            The maximum supply of HUE tokens is limited to 1 billion.


            Token distribution and issuance mechanisms can generally be divided into
            two types: mining and staking.


            - Mining: Users can mine HUE tokens by hosting AI models on their GPUs.
            Mining nodes require a minimum stake of 10,000 HUE or esHUE tokens to
            activate and will not receive rewards if the stake is below this value.
            The rewards for mining are in esHUE tokens, which are automatically compounded
            into the stake of the mining node. The reward rate depends on the GPU
            efficiency, normal operating time, the type of AI model being run, and
            the total stake in the node.

            - Staking: Users can stake HUE or esHUE tokens in miner nodes. The staking
            rewards are distributed in the form of HUE or esHUE tokens, with a higher
            yield for staking esHUE tokens than HUE tokens. Unlocking staked HUE tokens
            requires a 30-day lock-up period, while there is no lock-up period for
            unlocking staked esHUE. The esHUE rewards can be converted to HUE tokens
            over a linear release period of one year. Users can transfer their staked
            HUE or esHUE tokens from one miner node to another, promoting flexibility
            and competition among miners.


            The heuristic token distribution embodies the principles of fairness and
            community ownership, and its native token HEU can be used to pay for developers''
            computing resource costs, serve as the Gas cost for user transactions,
            and support staking and governance functions. In terms of allocation,
            50% is allocated to computing power providers, and early community distribution
            (including early miners and NFT holders) accounts for 7%. Heurist''s elastic
            token release rule dynamically adjusts the annual inflation rate between
            1.25% and 5%.

            Token burning mechanism


            Heurist implements a token burning mechanism, where a portion of HUE payment
            will be permanently removed from circulation when users pay for AI inference
            fees. The issuance and destruction of tokens are closely related to network
            activity. During periods of high usage, the token burn rate may exceed
            the issuance rate of new tokens, leading to a deflationary phase for the
            Heurist network. This mechanism helps regulate token supply and maintain
            token value in line with actual demand within the network.


            ## Summary


            Heurist is a decentralized Artificial Intelligence-as-a-Service (AIaaS)
            cloud platform that is redefining the hosting and inference of AI models
            through its innovative technical architecture and flexible resource management.
            By aggregating the computational resources of individual GPU owners and
            data centers, Heurist not only provides developers with efficient and
            serverless AI integration solutions, but also creates a stable income
            stream for GPU owners. Its core mechanisms, such as elastic scaling agreements,
            scalable layer 2 infrastructure, and zero-trust computing, ensure the
            security and efficiency of the platform. With the growing demand for AI
            services in the market, Heurist has a promising future and is expected
            to bring more value and opportunities to users and developers while driving
            the decentralized AI ecosystem forward.
